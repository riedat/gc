<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font color="#006666">1. Three NYDOT
Factors to Determine Whether You Qualify for a National Interest Waiver<br>
</font></b><br>
There is no doubt that a National Interest Waiver (NIW) is an attractive option for many of
alien applicants - yet there is still some confusion about what criteria the USCIS uses when considering NIW applicant.
The major case that defines the NIW factors used by the USCIS is known as NYDOT. In general, USCIS will look to these three NYDOT factors to determine whether you qualify for a National Interest Waiver:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>1) Whether the alien seeks employment in an area of substantial intrinsic
merit:</i> First you must establish that your occupation or your field of research possesses substantial intrinsic merit. In other words, your work must benefit the national interest in some way.
Generally, this factor is easily met and many applicants will not receive</font>

    </font>

<font FACE="Arial">
<font size="2" face="Arial">a Request for Additional Evidence (RFE) that uses this first factor as its basis.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>2) Whether the proposed benefit will be national in
scope:</i> The applicant must show that his or her undertaking or research field will provide a benefit on a national scale. The
applicant’s work must benefit a national goal rather than a local or regional goal. This second factor, like the first factor, is easily met as long as your work is in some way connected to a national scheme.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
<p align="left"><b><i><font size="2">Example:</font></i></b><font size="2"> Dr.
Raj is an electrical engineer who is working on the New York power grid to prevent the massive blackouts that the region recently suffered. Technically,
he is only helping the New York region with his work, yet the USCIS found that since the New York power grid connects to the national power grid; Dr.
Raj’s work was “national in scope”.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
<p align="left"><i><font size="2">3. Whether the alien will serve the national interest to a substantially greater degree than an available U.S. worker having the same minimum
qualifications: </font></i><font size="2">This final factor is the most important and difficult prong to satisfy. Here the USCIS requires you to demonstrate that your work will benefit the national interest to such a degree that it “considerably outweighs” the national interest of the labor certification program.&nbsp;</font></p>

    </font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font size="2"> For example, if you are a lab researcher with a Ph.D. you must be able to demonstrate that you are better than other U.S. lab researchers with a Ph.D. Showing a history of “significant contribution” to your field can do this. The USCIS wants to see that you have already made a substantial impact on your field. This can be done in a number of ways including evidence of any awards you have won, or by showing a large number of citations to your published works.
It is not enough to simply regurgitate an applicant’s CV or list of published works in the
petition letter.</font></font></p>
    <blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><i><b>Example:</b></i> Dr. Wong is a Post Doc researcher at a lab that is researching causes and treatments for hearing loss. There are literally thousands of medical researchers in the United States – the challenge in Dr.
Wong’s case was to differentiate him from all the other medical researchers to show that he would serve the national interest to a significantly greater degree than a similarly situated U.S. researcher.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"> Dr. Wong determined that three of
his studies could be considered ground breaking in comparison with the rest of the field.
He focused on these three studies and their practical applications to hearing treatments when discussing this third NYDOT factor.
He first explained the state of the research field in general and then discussed how
his ’s research significantly impacted a new direction of research and treatment in clear, simple terms that was easy for the adjudicating officer to follow.
His NIW was approved due to the strategy.</font></p>

The Exact Language of the NYDOT Case Decision</font></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Arial"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">The following is the exact language of the
decision by the Administrative Appeals Unit that INS (now USCIS) has stated it will use as a
standard while processing all NIW request pending before and after August 1,
1998.</font></font></p>
    <blockquote>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Arial"><font size="2" face="Arial">NEW YORK STATE DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION,
Petitioner<br>
In Visa Petition Proceedings&nbsp;<br>
EAC 96 063 51031</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Designated by the Acting Associate Commissioner,
Programs,<br>
August 7, 1998</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">(1) An alien seeking immigrant classification as
an alien of exceptional ability or as a member of the professions holding an
advanced degree cannot meet the threshold for a national interest waiver of the
job offer requirement simply by establishing a certain level of training or
education which could be articulated on an application for a labor
certification.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">(2) General arguments regarding the importance of
a given field of endeavor, or the urgency of an issue facing the United States,
cannot by themselves establish that an individual alien benefits the national
interest by virtue of engaging in the field or seeking an as yet undiscovered
solution to the problematic issue.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">(3) A shortage of qualified workers in a given
field, regardless of the nature of the occupation, does not constitute grounds
for a national interest waiver. Given that the labor certification process was
designed to address the issue of worker shortages, a shortage of qualified
workers is an argument for obtaining rather than waiving a labor certification.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">DISCUSSION</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The employment-based immigrant visa petition was
denied by the Director, Vermont Service Center, and is now before the Associate
Commissioner for Examinations on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The petitioner seeks to classify the beneficiary
pursuant to section 203(b)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. o
1153(b)(2), as a member of the professions holding an advanced degree. The
petitioner seeks to employ the beneficiary as a civil engineer. The petitioner
asserts that an exemption from the requirement of a job offer, and thus of a
labor certification, is in the national interest of the United States. The
director found that the beneficiary qualifies for classification as a member of
the professions holding an advanced degree but that the petitioner had not
established that an exemption from the requirement of a job offer would be in
the national interest of the United States.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Section 203(b) of the Act states in pertinent
part that:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Aliens
Who Are Members of the Professions Holding Advanced Degrees or Aliens of
Exceptional Ability. --</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) In
General. -- Visas shall be made available. . . to qualified immigrants who are
members of the professions holding advanced degrees or their equivalent or who
because of their exceptional ability in the sciences arts, or business, will
substantially benefit prospectively the national economy, cultural or
educational interests, or welfare of the United States, and whose services in
the sciences, arts, professions, or business are sought by an employer in the
United States.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Waiver of
Job Offer. -- The Attorney General may, when he deems it to be in the national
interest, waive the requirement of subparagraph (A) that an alien's services in
the sciences, arts, professions, or business be sought by an employer in the
United States. It appears from the record that the petitioner seeks to classify
the beneficiary both as an advanced degree professional and as an alien of
exceptional ability. The record establishes that the beneficiary holds a Master
of Science degree in Civil Engineering (Structures) from Iowa State University
and thus qualifies as a member of the professions holding an advanced degree.
The issue of whether the beneficiary is also an alien of exceptional ability is
moot. The remaining issue is whether the petitioner has established that a
waiver of the job offer requirement, and thus a labor certification, is in the
national interest.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Neither the statute nor Service regulations
define the term &quot;national interest.&quot; Additionally, Congress did not
provide a specific definition of &quot;in the national interest.&quot; The
Committee on the Judiciary merely noted in its report to the Senate that the
committee had &quot;focused on national interest by increasing the number and
proportion of visas for immigrants who would benefit the United States
economically and otherwise. . . .&quot; S. Rep. No. 55,1 O1 st Cong.,1 st Sess.,11
(1989).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Supplementary information to Service regulations
implementing the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), published at 56 Fed. Reg.
60897, 60900 (November 29,1991 ), states:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Service believes it appropriate to leave the
application of this test as flexible as possible, although clearly an alien
seeking to meet the [national interest] standard must make a showing
significantly above that necessary to prove the &quot;prospective national
benefit&quot; [required of aliens seeking to qualify as
&quot;exceptional.&quot;) The burden will rest with the alien to establish that
exemption from, or waiver of, the job offer will be in the national interest.
Each case is to be judged on its own merits.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Several factors must be considered when
evaluating a request for a national interest waiver. First, it must be shown
that the alien seeks employment in an area of substantial intrinsic merit. This
beneficiary's field of endeavor, engineering of bridges, clearly satisfies this
first threshold. The importance of bridges, and their proper maintenance, is
immediately apparent. It must be stressed, however, that eligibility is not
established solely by a showing that the beneficiary's field of endeavor has
intrinsic merit. A petitioner cannot establish qualification for a national
interest waiver based solely on the importance of the alien's occupation. It is
the position of the Service to grant national interest waivers on a case by case
basis, rather than to establish blanket waivers for entire fields of
specialization.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Next, it must be shown that the proposed benefit
will be national in scope. While the alien's employment may be limited to a
particular geographic area, New York's bridges and roads connect the state to
the national transportation system. The proper maintenance and operation of
these bridges and roads therefore serve the interests of other regions of the
country. Moreover, nothing in the record indicates that proper maintenance of
New York's transportation infrastructure would have an adverse impact on the
interests of other regions. We therefore conclude that the occupation in this
case serves the national interest.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The final threshold is therefore specific to the
alien. The petitioner seeking the waiver must persuasively demonstrate that the
national interest would be adversely affected if a labor certification were
required for the alien. The petitioner must demonstrate that it would be
contrary to the national interest to potentially deprive the prospective
employer of the services of the alien by making available to U.S. workers the
position sought by the alien. The labor certification process exists because
protecting the jobs and job opportunities of U.S. workers having the same
objective minimum qualifications as an alien seeking employment is in the
national interest. An alien seeking an exemption from this process must present
a national benefit so great as to outweigh the national interest inherent in the
labor certification process.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Stated another way, the petitioner, whether the
U.S. employer or the alien, must establish that the alien will serve the
national interest to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S.
worker having the same minimum qualifications. It is not sufficient for the
petitioner simply to enumerate the alien's qualifications, since the labor
certification process might reveal that an available U.S. worker has the
qualifications as well. Likewise, it cannot be argued that an alien qualifies
for a national interest waiver simply by virtue of playing an important role in
a given project, if such a role could be filled by a competent and available
U.S. worker. The alien must clearly present a significant benefit to the field
of endeavor.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With regard to the unavailability of qualified
U.S. workers, the job offer waiver based on national interest is not warranted
solely for the purpose of ameliorating a local labor shortage, because the labor
certification process is already in place to address such shortages. Similarly,
the Department of Labor allows a prospective U.S. employer to specify the
minimum education, training, experience, and other special requirements needed
to qualify for the position in question. Therefore, these qualifications, taken
alone, do not justify a waiver of the certification process which takes these
elements into account.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Because, by statute, &quot;exceptional
ability&quot; is not by itself sufficient cause for a national interest waiver,
the benefit which the alien presents to his or her field of endeavor must
greatly exceed the &quot;achievements and significant contributions&quot;
contemplated in the regulation at 8 C.F.R. o 204.5(k)(3)(?(F). Because the
statute and regulations contain no provision allowing a lower national interest
threshold for advanced degree professionals than for aliens of exceptional
ability, this standard must apply whether the alien seeks classification as an
alien of exceptional ability, or as a member of the professions holding an
advanced degree.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The petitioner's subjective assurance that the
alien will, in the future, serve the national interest cannot suffice to
establish prospective national benefit. While the national interest waiver
hinges on prospective national benefit, it clearly must be established that the
alien's past record justifies projections of future benefit to the national
interest. The inclusion of the term &quot;prospective&quot; is used here to
require future contributions by the alien, rather than to facilitate the entry
of an alien with no demonstrable prior achievements, and whose benefit to the
national interest would thus be entirely speculative.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The petitioner, the New York State Department of
Transportation (NYSDOT), has employed the beneficiary since November 1993. The
beneficiary's supervisor, Project Engineer Anil Desai, P.E., describes the
function of the NYSDOT Structures Division as &quot;the provision of
professional engineering services for the rehabilitation, replacement,
maintenance and inspection of bridges.&quot; Counsel states that the
beneficiary's &quot;expertise is in pre-stressed concrete construction and
design of post-tensioning and of curved bridges.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A.M. Shirole, P.E., then Director of Structures
and Deputy Chief Engineer at NYSDOT, stated in a November 3,1995 letter that 60%
of New York's bridges contain steel bearings which are susceptible to earthquake
damage. The beneficiary &quot;has been involved in detailed seismic analysis
using state-of the-art seismic analysis software.&quot; Mr. Shirole observes
that recent earthquakes have demonstrated &quot;the need for careful
implementation of new guidelines for improving the seismic resistance of
bridges.&quot; The petitioner has submitted evidence showing that the State of
New York has withstood four earthquakes at or above 5.0 on the Richter scale
since 1884, as well as numerous smaller earthquakes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The beneficiary also analyzes and designs curved
bridges, which &quot;can provide 10 to 15% economy over a conventional system
comprising of straight girders.&quot; Mr. Shirole asserted &quot;I am personally
aware of the national shortage of the type of expertise [the beneficiary]
possesses in the design of curved girder bridges.&quot; Knowledge of specialized
design techniques would appear to be a valid requirement for the petitioner to
set forth on an application for a labor certification. Mr. Shirole's assertion
of a labor shortage, therefore, should be tested through the labor certification
process.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mr. Shirole continued:<br>
32% of all bridges in the United States are deficient in some manner. . . . As
more and more of the bridges that were built in the post world war construction
boom reach the end of their service life, the nation's need for expert engineers
with experience in structural rehabilitation has already started out pacing
their availability, indicating their shortage in the industry's marketplace.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Harold J. Brown, Administrator of the New York
Division of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), states that &quot;the
work of the FHWA is in the national interest, as it will benefit the whole of
America in providing a safer and cost-effective traveling way across the
nation.&quot; Mr. Brown makes no specific assertion about the beneficiary,
offering only the general statement that &quot;maintenance of a trained and
competent engineering staff by each State DOT is paramount to the success of the
Federal Highway program.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The above arguments, and similar testimony from
numerous other witnesses, focus largely on the critical state of the bridges and
related infrastructure in New York and elsewhere in the United States. It is
indisputably true that the nation's bridges play a fundamental role in the
transportation system and, by extension, in the economy itself which depends on
the transportation of goods and mobility of commuters and tourists. The
employer's assertions regarding the overall importance of an alien's area of
expertise cannot suffice, however, to establish eligibility for a national
interest waiver. The issue in this case is not whether proper bridge maintenance
is in the national interest, but rather whether this particular beneficiary, to
a greater extent than U.S. workers having the same minimum qualifications, plays
a significant role in the preservation and construction of bridges.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Anil Desai asserts that the beneficiary's
&quot;qualifications make him ideally suited for the kind of complicated
engineering design that is done here.&quot; George A. Christian, P.E., Director
of the Bridge Design Section at NYSDOT, states that the beneficiary's prior work
experience &quot;was a key consideration in our hiring him in 1993.&quot; Lowell
Greimann, Chair of the Department of Civil and Construction Engineering at Iowa
State University, states that the beneficiary's &quot;unique background and
experience in the field of bridge rehabilitation by applying techniques such as
post-tensioning is a resource that can be applied toward the many bridge
projects upcoming in the United States.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Any objective qualifications which are necessary
for the performance of the occupation can be articulated in an application for
alien labor certification; the fact that the alien is qualified for the job does
not warrant a waiver of the job offer/labor certification requirement. It cannot
suffice to state that the alien possesses useful skills, or a &quot;unique
background.&quot; As noted above, regardless of the alien's particular
experience or skills, even assuming they are unique, the benefit the alien's
skills or background will provide to the United States must also considerably
outweigh the inherent national interest in protecting U.S. workers through the
labor certification process. P.Y. Manjure, Chief Executive of Freyssinet (India)
where the beneficiary worked for two years, states that the beneficiary
&quot;had rigorous training in the use and application of the world famous
Freyssinet System of Post-tensioning.&quot; Ayaz H. Malik, P.E., Chairman of the
Bridge Design Committee at NYSDOT, states that the beneficiary &quot;has worked
on innovative projects such as segmental arch structures patented by the French
company 'Matiere'.&quot; It is not clear in what capacity the beneficiary
&quot;worked on&quot; the Matiere project; the beneficiary's involvement with Freyssinet and Matiere, standing
alone, does not qualify him for a national interest waiver. Simple exposure to
advanced technology constitutes, essentially, occupational training which can be
articulated on an application for a labor certification. Special. or unusual
knowledge or training, while perhaps attractive to the prospective U.S.
employer; does not inherently meet the national interest threshold. The issue of
whether similarly-trained workers are available in the U.S. is an issue under
the jurisdiction of the Department of Labor. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">George A. Christian observes that NYSDOT, and
other federal and state agencies; are in the process of converting to metric
measurements: Mr. Christian notes that the beneficiary's previous experience
with metric measurements is aiding in this transition. The beneficiary's
knowledge of this system would not rise to the level of being in the national
interest for purposes of section 203(b)(2)(B) of the Act, since standard English
measurements can be converted to metric though simple and widely available
arithmetical formulas. Moreover, the metric system is accepted as the standard
throughout most of the industrialized world, and is therefore commonly known
among alien engineers. In any event, the employer's need for a worker trained in
the metric system can be expressed on an application for a labor certification.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Reports submitted on appeal reflect substantial
cost savings on projects on which the beneficiary worked. The record does not
show that these savings are due to the beneficiary's involvement, or that
comparable projects executed without the beneficiary incurred significantly
higher costs. The reports merely indicated that the projects on which the
beneficiary worked could have cost more than they actually did.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A number of the witnesses in this case assert
that engineers with the beneficiary's qualifications are in short supply, yet
are desperately needed because of the deterioration of U.S. bridges. The
petitioner has never clearly explained why the job offer and thus the labor
certification requirement should be waived. Given the asserted shortage of
qualified engineers with the requisite training, and the evident existence of an
offer of permanent employment, the situation appears to correspond closely to
the very situation that the labor certification process was designed to address.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mr. Christian states in a letter that the
beneficiary's &quot;training and on-the job experience becomes all the more
important since our engineering staff development is a cost-intensive, time
consuming process that affects the productivity and quality of the design
process.&quot; In fact, documents submitted subsequent to the appeal establish
the beneficiary's continued involvement in various projects undertaken by the
petitioner. The Service does not dispute that the beneficiary provides valuable
services to his employer; at issue here is the effect of such services on the
national interest when compared to others in the profession. The Service also
does not dispute the advantage to the petitioner of retaining qualified staff
rather than training inexperienced, newly hired workers. The contention that no
other experienced workers are available, however, should be tested on an
application for a labor certification. The petitioner has not shown that it will
suffer a substantial disruption in its efforts to maintain New York's bridges
and roads if a national interest waiver is not granted and the petitioner is
required to test the U.S. labor market through the labor certification process.
Furthermore, with regard to experience, the regulations indicate that ten years
of progressive experience is one possible criterion that may be used to
establish exceptional ability. Because exceptional ability, by itself, does not
justify a waiver of the job offer/labor certification requirement, arguments
hinging on the degree of experience required for the profession, while relevant,
are not dispositive to the matter at hand.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Based on the above discussion and a careful
review of the record, it is concluded that although the petitioner has shown
that the beneficiary is a competent engineer whose skills and abilities are of
value to his current employer, the petitioner has failed to establish that a job
offer waiver based on national interest is warranted. As is clear from a plain
reading of the statute, it was not the intent of Congress that every person
qualified to engage in a profession in the United States should be exempt from
the requirement of a job offer based on national interest. Likewise, it does not
appear to have been the intent of Congress to grant national interest waivers on
the basis of the overall importance of a given profession, rather than on the
merits of the individual alien as they relate to the job to be performed.
Moreover, the mere fact that an alien may play an important role in the activity
to be performed by the petitioner is insufficient to establish eligibility for a
job offer waiver based on national interest, since qualified U.S. workers may be
available to play a similar role. Nothing in the legislative history suggests
that the national interest waiver was intended simply as a means for employers
(or self petitioning aliens) to avoid the inconvenience of the labor
certification process. On the basis of the evidence submitted, the petitioner
has not established that a waiver of the requirement of an approved labor
certification will be in the national interest of the United States.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The burden of proof in these proceedings rests
solely with the petitioner. Section 291 of the Act, U.S.C. o 136l. The
petitioner has not sustained that burden. Accordingly, the decision of the
director denying the petition will not be disturbed:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This denial is without prejudice to the filing of
a new petition by a United States employer accompanied by a labor certification
issued by the Department of Labor, appropriate supporting evidence and fee.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.</font></p>
