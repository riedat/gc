  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Subject: Form I-140 EB2 National Interest Waiver
  Petition for Dr. Kihyung Yoon</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Sir or Madam:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This letter is in support of Dr. Kihyung Yoon’s petition to change his immigration status from
  H-1B to permanent resident. As Senior Director in the Immunology and Autoimmunity Research Unit as well as Member of the Postdoctoral Program Governance Committee at
  Merck, I am in a position to offer my expert opinion on Dr. Yoon’s scientific achievements and accomplishments in the field of human health and diseases.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Yoon graduated from Emory University College of Medicine with his PhD in viral immunology. During his PhD research, Dr.
  Yoon worked on the highly specialized dendritic cells in a unique mouse model of human T cell leukemia type 1 disease. Through his studies, he was able to demonstrate the critical role of dendritic cells in mediating protection against early cell-free but not cell-associated infection with HTLV-1. He has published in many high impact factor peer reviewed journals including two first author publications in the Journal of Immunology.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Based on Dr. Yoon’s strong credentials and his scientific expertise, he was accepted into the
  Merck Postdoctoral program after competing through a very stiff selection process. At
  Merck, Dr. Yoon has been working on understanding the inflammatory mechanism of Psoriasis, an autoimmune disease with significant number of patients in the USA and thus of national interest to this country.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In particular, through the use of mouse model of skin inflammation, that mimics symptoms seen in human psoriatic patients, Dr.
  Yoon has demonstrated that activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptors leads to the modulation of the inflammatory response and in turn up-regulating the frequency of the anti-inflammatory T regulatory cells. Through an array of in vitro experiments, Dr.
  Yoon demonstrated that the suppression in the inflammatory response following the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptors is mediated through activated dendritic cells. This finding has an important bearing on our understanding of the mechanism of action of aryl hydrocarbon receptors in being able to control psoriatic like skin inflammation, which could greatly benefit the
  healthcare of many people in the United States.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Yoon has served the U.S. national interest to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications. During the postdoctoral training period, Dr
  Yoon has been highly productive and demonstrated great scientific zeal and enthusiasm. He has already published two reviews and is currently in the process of submitting a manuscript to the Journal of Clinical Investigation, a top tier journal in the field of human medical science. In addition, Dr.
  Yoon’s work was one of the select abstracts chosen for oral presentation at the Annual
  Merck Postdoc Symposium. At this symposium, his work and presentation was well received by the judges and scientific audience, earning him the award for the “Best Oral Presentation”.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Yoon is an excellent scientist with immense potential. He has very well demonstrated his penchant for scientific knowledge through his intelligence and accomplishments, and he has played a significant role in an area of substantial intrinsic merit. Dr.
  Yoon’s continued research on autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and the role of dendritic cells in such diseases is intrinsic to the future of health care in this country. I fully support and recommend that his petition be granted. Please feel free to write, should further information be required.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Yours sincerely,<br>
  <br>
