  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Re: Form I-140 Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker
  in EB2 National Interest Waiver - Mr. Kevin Yong</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear USCIS Officer:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is my pleasure to support Mr. Kevin Yong's
petition for immigration to the United States in the EB2 National Interest
Waiver category. I am writing this letter to provide evidence
that his research and development work is in the national interest of United
States.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">My name is Alexandre Rosa, Chairman of the Technology Program
Committee at General Electric (GE) Power Systems. Mr. Kevin Yong is presently a researcher
at GE Power System developing the Electronic Document Management System (EDMS). Coming from INT International as a key
researcher and developer in the project, Mr.
Kevin Yong is productive and
has been working on the EDMS project, funded by GE, for the past three years.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">At GE Power Systems, project documents for
federal government and companies in United States and in other countries need to
be carefully managed. Control of design documents through a product’s life
cycle is also required for regulatory compliance. In traditional engineering
environments, manual document handling and workflow process were used, which may
lead to loss of data and time.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> With EDMS research and development, it is easy to
access, store, and track many types of documents. Also, electronic forms may be
created to ensure that all information is documented while performing a
procedure. Currently, critical documents and engineering drawings exchanged
between GE and its customers, including U.S. federal government agencies like
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), are managed by EDMS.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">EDMS research and development is not only crucial
for U.S. company’s business but also important for the government and our
nation’s future. In the language of Section 3301, in legislation codified
under Title 44 of the United States Code, government’s documents and records
need to be securely managed <i> &quot;as evidence of the organization, functions,
policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the
Government or because of the informational value of data in them.&quot; </i>
According to a report submitted to the U.S. Congress in 2007 by Archivist of the
United States, John W. Carlin, the government’s <i> &quot;electronic records will
increase by more than 300 times the volume in the near future.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The research and implementation of EDMS also
helps U.S. companies keep a competitive advantage in the international market by
achieving enterprise-wide business and mission critical information management.
Previously, an old database program was used to manage Vendor Document (VENDOC) at GE
Power Systems for all documents and drawings exchanged between GE and its
vendors. With the obsolete architectures, this
system could not help GE maintain technical competitiveness over its major
foreign competitors, such as ABB and Siemems.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Recently, a newly designed VENDOC
process in the EDMS, with secure document revision control and worldwide
document access ability, has replaced the old database system. As a principal
developer, Mr. Kevin Yong demonstrated his excellent research ability by
integrating new techniques.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">From GE’s annual report, GE’s revenues and
earnings have reached a double-digit growth in 2006. GE Power System relies on
the international market for its growth, and has brought more and more jobs to
our nation since 2008. EDMS project improves the U.S. economy by helping
companies improve its management and create more job opportunities for U.S.
workers.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mr. Kevin Yong’s current EDMS research project can
also benefit U.S. government agencies. As government projects, more regulation
requirements need to be met for the TVA projects: TVA-NEW01 and TVA-GALLATIN.
For these projects, GE assumes the entire scope of the power plant design from
the feasibility study to commercialization. The traditional manual Action Item
processing method is not a acceptable solution for projects like TVA. By
applying EDMS in TVA projects, documents exchanged between TVA and GE may be
handled by EDMS; quicker response to TVA’s Action Items can be performed; and
government’s regulatory and ISO-9002 standard have been met.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Five years ago, a Young
Researcher Program (YRP) was established by GE to provide opportunities for outstanding young
researchers inside and outside GE to present their achievements in research. The participants’ work was recognized and awarded in the form of
several Fellowships. The enrollment into this program is highly competitive, where only about
15 young scientists and researchers were strictly selected by the review panel to participate the program from more than
800 applicants all over the world. Therefore, each YRP participant is without a doubt one of the most brilliant and promising young scientists in the world. Mr. Yong
is one of the YRP participants this year. He was invited to attend the program and give
an orally presentation in a special session held on the last day of the YRP
conference at Austin, Texas. Only a very few participants had the honor to present their work
orally at the yearly YRP conference.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Also, as an expert and Chairman of the Technology Program
Committee at GE Power Systems, I attended the EDMS presentation session recently
at a national conference held at Cincinnati, Ohio, and further discussed with Mr. Yong
on his research during the banquet following the presentation. Mr. Yong elegantly presented his
work and impressed me and other experts with his profound knowledge in the
field. Mr. Yong’s study and development in the EDMS in many aspects greatly
helped to expand our understanding and application of EDMS in the industry. The research
in this field has tremendous potential in that the approaches he used can be applied to the study of other
related fields.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Knowing Mr. Yong's work since June 2008, I
am impressed with his research and development capabilities. He has a strong
  mathematics and information technology background. He also
has deep knowledge associated with electronic document management. Mr. Kevin Yong
is a principal researcher in the EDMS project at GE, who can effectively solve
difficult theoretical problems and challenging practical problems. He has
established himself as an active researcher and developer in the field of EDMS
and information technology over the past few years.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mr. Yong is also a highly self-motivated and productive
  researcher. Considering the amount of work, Mr. Yong’s productivity is very unusual. Judging from
  Mr. Yong’s record in research and his exceptional performance, I firmly believe that he
will be a successful researcher in future. I strongly feel that Mr. Yong will be an important asset of the United States,
  and recommend that he be granted permanent residency.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I hope this letter will fully support Mr. Kevin Yong’s
petition for a change of his visa status, so he can continue his research and
development projects in EDMS and other related information technology fields.
His research is certainly in the national interest of the United States, in light
of improving U.S. economy, bringing more jobs to U.S. workers, and saving our
nation’s legacy. If I can be of further assistance in support of his
application, please feel free to contact me.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sincerely yours,</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Committee<br>GE Power Systems</font></p>
