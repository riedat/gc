<p><font size="2" face="Arial">RE: Form I-140 Petition of EB2 National Interest
Waiver for Dr. Ming Lin</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Center Director:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This letter is written in support of Dr. Lin's petition for the National
Interest Waiver (Form I-140) to the United States. I was an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical
Engineering at the Stanford University from 2002 to 2008.
Since July 2010, I have been a visiting Senior Research Scientist with the U.S.
Army Research Laboratory working on image compression and Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR). I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at the U.S. Army
Research Laboratory.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial"> I have published more than 80 scientific research papers.
I am a senior member of the IEEE, and served as an associate editor for the IEEE
Transactions on Image Processing from 2004 to 2009, and currently serve as an
associate editor for the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video
Technology since 2008. I have hosted a SPIE annual symposium since 2006.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Lin&nbsp; came to Stanford University to study toward his Ph.D.
degree in Electrical Engineering, armed with a Master's
degree in Physics and teaching and industry experience. For the
last four years, he has been working with me on a number of research projects in
the fields of artificial neural networks, image compression, and Automatic
    Target Recognition, which are very important to United States' national
    defense and military technology development.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> During this period, he has demonstrated exceptional
research skills. His novel work in machine learning and image processing has
been well received in both academia and the military. The following is a brief
discussion of Dr. Lin's important and original contributions to United States
    military technology, and its great benefits to United States' National
    Interests.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Project #1: Image Prediction using Neural Networks</font></p>
    </b> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Description: Image prediction is a powerful tool that is commonly used by
a class of image compression techniques, called predictive coding schemes. A
predictor, in a typical predictive coding scheme, is used to estimate the gray
level of a pixel by using the information from several neighboring pixels. The
success of prediction (estimating the future from the past to some level of
correctness) reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. In this
project, Dr. Lin investigated several artificial neural network architectures that
can be used to implement a nonlinear vector predictor, including the Multi-layer
Perceptron, the Functional Link network, and the Radial Basis Function network.
Our experimental results show that a neural network predictor can successfully
predict image blocks.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Significance of the Project: The neural network approach provides a
solution to the problem of designing a nonlinear vector predictor. The neural
network predictors are found to have improved performance, in comparison to
conventional linear predictors, both numerically and perceptually. Moreover, the
neural network predictors predict the blocks that contain edges with greater
accuracy than a linear predictor. These neural network predictors have been used
as a building block for other image coding projects.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Project #2: Entropy-Constrained Predictive Residual Vector Quantization</font></p>
    </b> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Description: This project developed a new variable-rate vector
quantization (VQ) coding scheme, called Entropy-Constrained Predictive Residual
Vector Quantization (EC-PRVQ), which is designed by imposing a constraint on the
output entropy of the Predictive Residual Vector Quantization (PRVQ). The EC-PRVQ
operates at compression ratios of 8 through 40, which is appropriate in most
real-life compression applications.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Significance of the Project: The proposed EC-PRVQ is found to give
excellent rate-distortion performance and clearly outperforms the
state-of-the-art image compression algorithm JPEG. The robustness of the EC-PRVQ
is demonstrated by encoding several test images taken from outside the training
data. The EC-PRVQ not only gives better performance than JPEG, but also retains
the inherent simplicity of a VQ decoder. This property makes the EC-PRVQ
suitable for broadcasting applications, in which a single encoder (at the
transmitter) serves a large number of decoders (millions of decoders, such as TV
sets). Therefore, the overall system cost is substantially lower, in comparison
with the JPEG.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Project #3: Modular Neural Network Vector Predictor</font></p>
    </b>  
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Description: In this project, Dr. Lin developed a modular neural network
vector predictor in order to improve the predictive component of a Predictive
Vector Quantization (PVQ) scheme. Neural network predictors have been found to
improve the perceptual quality of the reconstructed image,
especially when predicting the edge blocks. The ability of the neural network to
learn (predict) complex input patterns can further be exploited if we decompose
the training data set (based on statistical properties of the input data) into
several classes (subsets) and then use a dedicated expert to predict the vectors
that be long to each particular class.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial"> The proposed vector prediction technique
consists of five dedicated predictors (experts), where each expert predictor is
optimized for a particular class of input vectors. One expert is optimized for
stationary blocks, and each of the other four experts are optimized to predict
horizontal, vertical, 45&quot;, and 1350 diagonally oriented edge-blocks,
respectively. An integrating unit is then used to select or combine the outputs
of the experts in order to form the final output of the modular network.
Therefore, no side information is required to transmit to the receiver about the
predictor selection.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Significance of the Project: Experimental results show that the proposed
scheme gives an improvement of 1 to 1.5 dB better than a single Multi-Layer Perception (MLP)
predictor. If the information about the predictor selection is
sent to the receiver, the improvement could be up to 3 dB over the single MLP
predictor. The perceptual quality of the predicted images is also significantly
improved. Nonetheless, other than image prediction applications, the modular
neural network can also be adopted to any problems involving mixture models such
as target recognition, time-series prediction, medical diagnosis, etc.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Project #4: Adaptive Predictive Residual Vector Quantization</font></p>
    </b> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Description: In contrast to natural images where every region in the
image is off interest, in FLIR imagery we are more interested in those areas of
the image where a potential target may be found. The existing image compression
methods, such as JPEG, treat all areas of an image equally. This results in a
relatively high bit rate for achieving a sufficiently high quality in the areas
containing potential targets in the reconstructed image. In this project, we
presented an adaptive technique based on Predictive Residual Vector Quantization
(PRVQ).&nbsp;</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial"> The main idea behind this technique is to treat different areas of the
image in an order of priority which is determined by the subsequent application
of the transmitted FLIR imagery. Basically, we partition the image into two
types of regions: the areas of the image containing background are defined as
the low-priority regions and the areas of the image containing potential targets
are defined as the high-priority regions. A relatively small number of bits is
assigned to the low-priority regions as compared to the high-priority regions.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Significance of the Project: It is imperative to apply a suitable image
compression technique in order to reduce the memory space and transmission
bandwidth taken by FLIR images. The quality of the FLIR images is of paramount
importance. In ATR applications, the regions in the image representing targets
must be reproduced with high accuracy in order to minimize errors in the target
detection process. The FLIR images are to be transmitted over low bit rate
channels (typically 5-10 kb/s).&nbsp;</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial"> The challenge to the researchers is to develop a
compression technique that produces a high quality reconstructed image (so that
the potential targets could be extracted with minimum distortion) at a very high
compression ratio (in order to fulfill the very low bit rate channel
requirements). The simulation result shows that the proposed scheme outperforms
JPEG by 3 dB. It was observed that the proposed scheme produces high-priority
regions with significantly higher accuracy than those produced by JPEG. In
JPEG-compressed target chips, areas of the chip were distorted, which can
severely affect the subsequent target detection process.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Project #5: Automatic Target Recognition using a Committee of Networks</font></p>
    </b> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Description: Classification of targets is realized
hierarchically. The local structure of a target image is captured by extraction
of the directional variance features at different resolutions in small image
blocks. These image blocks are organized, by location, into several larger image
regions, called super-blocks. An individual neural network in the committee is
designed to classify targets using only the local features in a single
super-block. At the final level, the classification results of the neural
networks for the individual super-blocks are further combined to produce the
final classification.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Significance of the Project: A committee of networks offers several
advantages over a single neural net. First, the proposed classifier is robust to
partial target occlusion. Each neural network in the committee is trained
independently. The occlusion of some portion of a target has no effect on the
decisions of the other neural networks at the first classification stage.
Second, by dividing the whole target image into several receptive fields, we
allow each neural network classifier to have fewer inputs and hence less
complexity. Third, stacked generalization is proved to further improve the
performance of the classifier by combining the outputs of each neural network in
the committee in a nonlinear manner. Finally, this architecture allows us to add
features to the classifier by training a separate neural network and only
changing the highest level, stacked-generalization MLP.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">From these projects, Dr. Lin has performed a lot image prediction,
artificial neural networks in theory and in practice, and modular approaches in
solving complex problems. His thoroughness and his depth of understanding was demonstrated in
the course of these projects. Dr. Lin's efforts have recently drawn significant recognition from the
U.S. Army Research Laboratory and
image processing research communities. He has published three journal papers and
fifteen conference papers in reputable IEEE and SPIE journals, conference
proceedings, and symposia. He has three additional papers under review for
potential publication in IEEE journals and conferences. I am very
pleased with his research achievements.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Lin has made significant contributions to the
image and ATR technologies, which are extremely important to U.S. military and
our country's national defense. His unique
research experience and technical background are essential for ATR research
activities. I do believe that it is very difficult to find another
researcher who has Dr. Lin's research experience and knowledge in image processing
technologies for military applications.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Lin's continued contribution to ATR
projects is strongly desired and is a substantial benefit to the United
States. For these reasons, the EO/IR Image Processing Branch has offered a position as a
Post-Doctoral research fellow starting in April of this year. I hope that Dr. Lin
remains on a permanent basis in the United States where
he can directly contribute to the research.</font></p>
