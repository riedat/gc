      NIW Applicants Should Benefit the U.S. National Interest more than a
      Similarly Situated U.S. Worker&nbsp;</font></font></b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">
<font size="2" face="Arial">Based on a careful survey of denied cases from the USCIS AAO (Administrative Appeals Office), and we have discovered
that in many cases, there is usually a deficiency in the labor certification argument.
The primary purpose of an NIW based EB-2 petition is to attack the labor certification requirement by showing that you can
benefit the U.S. national interest more than a similarly situated U.S. worker. It is apparent that most petitioners understand
that they must address the labor certification issue, but in many cases, their arguments are weak, ineffective, and even worse,
damaging to the overall effectiveness of the NIW petition.<br>
<br>
Below it a list of the most repeated and ineffective labor certification arguments from the denied cases from the AAO.
We also provide explanations as to why these arguments are unpersuasive to USCIS. A proper understanding of why these arguments
fail will deepen your comprehension of what factors USCIS looks for when deciding whether or not to grant you a waiver from the
labor certification process.<br>
<br>
Ineffective labor certification arguments can be divided into six basic categories. While the exact wording for each of the
arguments differs depending on the petition, the basic premise for each argument remains the same and should be avoided.</font>

<b><i><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Ineffective NIW Labor Certification
Argument:</font></i></b><font size="2" face="Arial">  “If forced to go through the labor certification process, the Petitioner’s nonimmigrant status will run out, and Petitioner’s
nationally important research will be cut short”<br>
<br>
<i>Why USCIS will find this argument unpersuasive:&nbsp;<br>
</i><br>
The NIW petitioner is not required to show that there is any urgency for the adjustment to lawful permanent resident status.
Temporal considerations are not a part of the criteria that USCIS considers when adjudicating an NIW petition. If this argument
were a factor, it would lead to the spurious conclusion that the work of a petitioner whose nonimmigrant status is about to
expire is inherently more nationally important than a petitioner who just received their nonimmigrant status. Thus, labor
certification arguments based on timeliness or urgency due to Petitioner’s nonimmigrant status do not carry any weight.</font>

Argument:</i></font></b><font size="2" face="Arial">  “Funding issues prevent the
petitioner’s employer from sponsoring the labor certification process.”<br>
<br>
<i>Why USCIS will find this argument unpersuasive:&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>
Taking this argument to its logical conclusion would mean that at least partially, the NIW program must have been established for
the benefit of employers who could not afford the financial burden of the labor certification process. This is most certainly not
the case – working for an employer of modest means does not make your work any more or less in the national interest.<br>
<br>
<b><i>3) Ineffective NIW Labor Certification Argument:</i></b>  “The Labor certification process does not lend itself to aliens who, like the Petitioner, are post doctorate fellows. The very
nature of post-doctorate work is that it is temporary and for a short duration. Accordingly, the only option for post-doctorate
fellows to obtain immigrant status is to seek a national interest waiver.”</font>

<i><font size="2" face="Arial">Why USCIS will find this argument unpersuasive:&nbsp;</font></i><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
<br>
If this argument in and of itself were given persuasive effect then it would mean that all post doc researchers would have an
inherent advantage for an NIW approval. USCIS has stated time and time again that such a blanket waiver for any field of
specialization will not be granted. While this argument may not harm your petition, do not place much stock on its persuasive
effect.<br>
<br>
USCIS will look at each petition on a case-by-case basis and each petitioner must first show that he or she will serve the
national interest on the merits of his or her own qualifications. The unavailability of the labor certification process might be
given consideration in appropriate cases, but the petitioner still must prove their benefit to the national interest whether or
not the position is temporary in nature.</font>

        “The employer is unable to seek a labor certification because its corporate headquarters has a firm policy against Green
        Card sponsorship. If this policy were not in place, the employer would gladly go through the labor certification
        process, because Petitioner’s work is critical, not only to the employer’s interests, but the nation’s interest as well.”<br>
        <br>
        <i>Why USCIS will find this argument unpersuasive:<br>
        </i><br>
        The employer’s decision not to utilize the labor certification process does not obligate USCIS to grant a waiver of the process
        to that employer’s employees. If this were so, every employer would make a policy against sponsoring labor certifications and opt
        for the NIW process.</font>

        &quot;As demonstrated by the above data, scientists specializing in this type of nuclear physics are in high demand in this country.
        In fact, Dr.Smith, head of the National Energy Committee stated in a recent interview, ‘the shortage of nuclear physicists in
        this country is one of our most pressing needs in terms of national security.’”<br>
        <br>
        <i>Why USCIS will find this argument unpersuasive:&nbsp;</i><br>
        <br>
        As stated above, eligibility for an NIW is dependent on the Petitioner’s own qualifications and not with the position sought.
        USCIS will not give a blanket waiver for any field of specialization.<br>
        <br>
        This argument is one of the more popular ones, and unfortunately, it is an argument that can injure your NIW petition. The labor
        certification program was put into place specifically to address worker shortages. By using the above argument, you are
        effectively claiming that there is a worker shortage in the area that the Petitioner works in, thus implying that a labor
        certification should be utilized for this case. This is the exact opposite of what you are arguing for in an NIW petition.</font>

        “The rare combination of experience and education recounted above demonstrates the unique skills of the of petitioner and proves
        her benefit to the national interest.”<br>
        <br>
        <i>Why USCIS will find this argument unpersuasive:&nbsp;<br>
        </i><br>
        This argument is not incorrect as much as it is incomplete. USCIS will reject any argument that unique skills or knowledge
        warrant a waiver from the labor certification process. To USCIS, the petitioner’s unique skills or experience do not matter
        - what does matter is how petitioner’s skills, unique or otherwise, can benefit that U.S. national interest. To do this, you must
        show how petitioner’s specific accomplishments have influenced the field to a greater degree than a similarly qualified U.S.
        worker.</font>
