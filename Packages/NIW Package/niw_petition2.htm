</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This is to file a Form I-140 immigration petition for myself in the EB2 immigration category of National Interest Waiver, with the waiver of Labor Certification. Enclosed please find an I-140 form, application fee, and supporting documents. Your help to my petition is greatly appreciated.</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">INTRODUCTION</font></b>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I currently hold H-1B status, and I am employed by the Department of Carcinogenesis at Woody Cancer Center, School of Medicine, New York University, on a full-time basis as a postdoctoral fellow. The Woody Cancer Center is one of the world’s most respected centers devoted exclusively to cancer research. As recognition of my outstanding research performance and contributions to the field, I was awarded a highly competitive Higgins Fellowship by New York University School of Medicine for the last two years (Exhibit 1).</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I amply qualify for the offered position due to my outstanding research ability, unique set of research skills, professional experience, and strong educational background in both biochemistry and molecular biology. As a leading researcher in the chromatin field, I am currently investigating the functions of chromatin remodeling complexes in the DNA repair, which is a major defense against environmental damage to cells.</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">My exceptional research performance attributes to my education and self-motivation. After receiving my B.S. degree in Molecular Biology from the highly prestigious Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur in
2000 (Exhibit 2), I worked three years as a researcher at Bangalore Biotechnology Inc., which is a leading enterprise in the industrialization of recombinant products in India (Exhibit 3). During this period of time, I performed research for intermediate products of Interferon-&#945;2b human recombinant, and I also did the research and development of a new dosage form for this product.</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Thereafter, I went to the United States to get my M.S. degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from University of Rochester (Exhibit 2). During my study at University of Rochester, I demonstrated that the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), which is the key molecule involved in Alzheimer’s disease, is directly involved in cell transformation. This finding provides new insight into pathogenesis and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, I played a crucial role in establishing a new method for isolating differentially expressed gene. Both of these studies were presented at the 10th International Congress on Genes, Gene Families and Isozymes (Exhibit 4).</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In May 2008, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Columbia University. I was awarded a Graduate Research Assistantship for five consecutive years, which is a major prize for outstanding graduate student researchers. As a leading researcher in Prof. Mattew Rowell’s laboratory, I played a key role in several research projects focused on nucleosome structure and chromatin dynamics. I demonstrated my exceptional research ability by making significant contributions to the field, and published excellent research results at several prestigious national and international scientific magazines.</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For example, during my PhD research, I conducted structural and functional studies of the Nucleosome Core Particles containing histone Sin mutant. This research project was supported by NIH Grant 62704. The so-called Sin (Swi-Independent) mutations in the genes for histones H3 and H4 partially alleviate the transcription defects caused by the inactivation of the yeast chromatin remodeling factor SWI/SNF. I tested the different hypotheses by which histone Sin mutations may overcome an SWI/SNF deficiency by determining the crystal structures of nucleosome core particles (NCPs) reconstituted with histones bearing the original Sin mutants, and by analyzing the stability and sliding properties of mutant NCPs in solution. I found that the disruption of only 2 to 6 of the ~ 120 direct histone-DNA interactions within the nucleosome has a pronounced effect on nucleosome mobility and stability. This study has implications for our understanding of how these structures are made accessible to the transcription, replication and repair machinery. This important discovery was published in the prestigious Journal of Biological Chemistry, and has been cited 11 times by fellow researchers (Exhibit 5).</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As a postdoctoral fellow at New York University presently, I am studying the optimization of the method for reconstitution nucleosome core particles from recombinant histones and DNA. Some of the optimized methods have been published in Methods Enzymology, which is a prestigious research experimental method journal, and has been cited 13 times so far by fellow researchers. This paper provides detailed description of experimental methods to the field (Exhibit 6).</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">With three years of industry experience, more than ten years of research experience, and a PhD degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, I have made excellent accomplishments in all the research projects that I participated, and made significant contributions to the field. I also have published 15 research papers in several prestigious journals, and my research results have been cited 51 times so far by scientists from more than 10 countries (Exhibits 15, 16).</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In summary, I have established myself as an outstanding researcher in the field of nucleosome structure and chromatin dynamics. I have also contributed several important discoveries in the field, and have accumulated evidence that clearly shows that I am an outstanding scientist in the field. My academic credentials and past achievements have demonstrated that I am an outstanding researcher and have influenced the field significantly. Therefore, I have established that I have a past record of specific prior achievement that justifies projections of future benefit to the U.S. national interest.</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">EVIDENCE PURSUANT TO THE EB2 NATIONAL INTEREST WAIVER REGULATIONS</font></b>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">According to a published precedent decision, Matter of N.Y. State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), Interim Decision No. 3363 (Acting Assoc. Comm'r Aug. 7, 1998), which translated "National Interest" into a set of conceptual guidelines, and generally asks an alien applicant to prove the eligibility for the National Interest Waiver petition according to the three-prong test setup in the case of
NYSDOT:</font>
</p>

      <blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">(1)	The applicant must be working in an area of "substantial intrinsic merit;"</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">(2)	The proposed benefit has to be “national in scope;”&nbsp;</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">(3)	The petitioner seeking the waiver must persuasively demonstrate that he or she will serve the national interest to a substantially better degree than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications, and the national interest would be adversely affected if a labor certification were required for the beneficiary.</font>
</p>

      </blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">My research work and my scientific contributions in the field can be useful to protect life and bring great benefits to the national interests of the United States. In order for an applicant to qualify for EB2-National Interest Waiver petition, the immigration regulations require that the alien applicant must meet criteria outlined in the regulations. In the following sections, I will provide evidence to demonstrate that I meet all the eligibility requirements of EB2-National Interest Waiver in the three-prong test, which clearly indicates that I am an alien with exceptional ability in medical science and research, and my permanent residence in the United States is in the U.S. National Interest.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>1) Evidence of my employment in an area of substantial intrinsic merit</b><br>
<br>
United States gives great importance to improve healthcare system by biomedical research funding through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF). I strongly believe that more than ten years of my comprehensive experience and my talents in the biomedical research will greatly benefit this country, and my employment is in an area of substantial intrinsic merit. The DNA repair is involved in processes that minimize cell killing, mutations, replication errors, persistence of DNA damage, and genomic instability. The abnormalities in these processes have been implicated in cancer, and I have made significant scientific contributions in the field.<br>
<br>
According to American Cancer Society's (ACS) annual report, cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States, and it killed an estimated more than half a million Americans in last year, or more than 1500 people a day. Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. If the spread is not controlled, it can result in death. Cancer is caused by both external factors (tobacco, infectious organisms, chemicals, and radiation) and internal factors (inherited mutations, hormones, immune conditions, and mutations that occur from metabolism). These causal factors may act together or in sequence to initiate or promote carcinogenesis.<br>
<br>
Ten or more years often pass between exposure to external factors and detectable cancer. Cancer is treated with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, biological therapy, and targeted therapy. The American Cancer Society estimates that in
2011 about 169,000 cancer deaths are expected to be caused by tobacco use. Scientific evidence suggests that about one-third of the 562,340 cancer deaths occurred in
2011 was related to overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, and poor nutrition.<br>
<br>
I have played a crucial role in a number of projects supported by National Institute of Health and American Cancer Society, because of my exceptional research ability. I am also the most productive researcher in both my previous research lab at Columbia University and the current research lab at New York University School of Medicine.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
My current research projects at the Woody Cancer Center of New York University School of Medicine include the investigating the function of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes in regulation of the activities of ATM, which is one of the key players in DNA repair pathways. This project is sponsored by the American Cancer Society (ACS), and the project grant number is "RSG-05-060-01-GMC". This research will provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the carcinogenesis related to the DNA repair. According to our previous research results, we have suggested that blocking the activity of ATM might make most types of tumor much more sensitive to radiation therapy. Thus, this research has far-reaching implications for the development of cutting-edge therapies for cancer. It will greatly benefit millions of cancer sufferers both in the United States and in other countries.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
My another project is investigating the structure and function of actin/ARP (Actin Related Protein) modules in chromatin remodeling complexes. This project is sponsored by the National Institute of Health. Although actin is one of the most important and evolutionarily conserved molecules of the cell, its functions in the cell nucleus remain poorly defined. This project is important for understanding the functions of actin and ARPs in the nucleus, and it will provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of chromatin modifications during DNA repair. As a project leader, our research has made significant progress and I have published 3 papers at the prestigious scientific journals, including Cell, which is a premier journal in life science field. (Exhibit 7).<br>
<br>
Evidence submitted for the criterion of my employment in the area of substantial intrinsic merit is contained throughout this application, including my publications and citation information. The evidence is also emphasized in the recommendation letters from the leading researchers in the field. For example, as one of the nation’s foremost chromatin scientists and an independent expert, Prof. Brian Garacci from Harvard University School of Medicine provided his professional opinion about my work’s intrinsic merit and my scientific contribution to the field. In his recommendation letter, Prof. Brian Garacci said that “Dr. Shetty and his colleagues found a novel role for Nucleosome Assembly Protein 1 (NAP-1) in mediating chromatin fluidity by incorporating histone variants and assisting nucleosome remodeling. This work is extremely important in understanding the mechanism of nucleosome assembly, and has been widely followed by many researchers all over the world in their own research projects. Dr. Shetty is a well established and productive researcher, as demonstrated by his well cited papers published in primary professional and international journals. In particular, he is a leading researcher in the field of nucleosome structure and dynamics, which currently constitutes a critical area of biological research." (Exhibit 8)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In a recommendation letter from Prof. Mattew Rowell who is a professor in Biochemistry at Columbia University, Prof. Rowell wrote that "Dr. Shetty made several important original contributions in characterizing effects of histone variants on chromatin dynamics. He discovered that the incorporation of histone variant called H2A.Bbd into a nucleosome alters the conformation of the nucleosome in a manner that facilitates the DNA transcription process. This study provided important evidence for the emerging theory that incorporation of a histone variant into a nucleosome is an alternative way to modulate chromatin structure in addition to histone modifications. This work was one of such great importance that it was quickly accepted for publication in the highly cited biomedical journal, EMBO Journal. Dr. Shetty is a highly creative researcher with a solid record of achievement. I believe that his employment is in an area of substantial intrinsic merit, and his contribution to DNA research will benefit U.S. healthcare in national scope.” (Exhibit 11)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
These recommendation letters from experts in the field, my published research papers, and other attached documents clearly establish that my employment is in an area of substantial intrinsic merit, and my original scientific contributions are of major significance to the nucleosome and chromatin research field. It is also obvious that my work has earned me a national and international reputation in the chromatin research community. Therefore, my work focusing on basic research of DNA repair and cancer is in U.S. national interest, and it is in an area of substantial intrinsic merit.<br>
<br>
<b>2) Evidence of the proposed benefit has to be national in scope<br>
</b><br>
My research work has great significance to the advancement of knowledge towards understanding the causative factors and mechanisms involved in DNA and cancer processes, and it points to the ways of finding a cure for those who suffer from severe dysfunction.</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As we know, all cancers involve the malfunction of genes that control cell growth and division. About 5% of all cancers are strongly hereditary, in that an inherited genetic alteration confers a very high risk of developing one or more specific types of cancer. However, most cancers do not result from inherited genes but from damage to genes occurring during one’s lifetime. Genetic damage may result from internal factors, such as hormones or the metabolism of nutrients within cells, or external factors, such as tobacco, chemicals, and sunlight.</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Certain cancers are related to infectious agents, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), human papillomavirus (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori), and others, and could be prevented through behavioral changes, vaccines, or antibiotics. In the United States, men have slightly less than a 1 in 2 lifetime risk of developing cancer; for women, the risk is a little more than 1 in 3. According to American Cancer Society's statistics number, approximately 1.4 million people were diagnosed with cancer in the United States in year
2011, and the overall cost of cancer in 2011 alone is about $230 billion. Thus, my work focusing on basic cancer research is in U.S. national interest, and the proposed benefit is national in
scope.</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I have made significant scientific contributions in chromatin and DNA repair research. For example, in the eukaryotic cells, such as a human cell, DNA is tightly packed together with proteins into a complex called chromatin. The fundamental subunit of chromatin is a nucleosome, which is made up of a disk of histone proteins surrounded by DNA. The chromatin is important for regulating gene expression, and numerous diseases have been found to be caused by mutations in genes involved in the maintenance and remodeling of chromatin structure. Hence, an understanding of nucleosome structure and chromatin dynamics is essential for the design of rational approaches to disease treatment. The followings are a summary of 2 research projects that I finished at Columbia University and New York University:</font>
</p>

      <blockquote>

<p align="left"><u><font size="2" face="Arial">Structural and functional studies of the Nucleosome Core Particle (NCP) containing histone variant H2A.Bbd (finished at Columbia University):</font></u><font size="2" face="Arial"> This research project was sponsored by National Institute of Health (NIH) grant 61909 and by the Human Frontier Science Program. The H2A.Bbd is an unusual histone variant, and its sequence is only 48% conserved compared to major H2A. I assembled nucleosomes in which H2A is replaced by H2A.Bbd (Bbd-NCP) and found that Bbd-NCP had a more relaxed structure in which only 118±2 bp of DNA are protected against digestion with micrococcal nuclease. Then, it was determined that this behavior was caused mainly by the Bbd docking domain. I further found that Bbd-containing nucleosomal arrays repress transcription less efficiently than chromatin reconstituted with major-type histones. This remarkable discovery was published in the highly cited European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) Journal and has been cited 12 times by fellow researchers (Exhibit 9).<br>
<br>
In this project, I also studied the structural and function of the NCP containing poly (dA&#903;dT) element. The poly (dA&#903;dT) elements have been suggested to promote transcriptional activation by altering the stability or dynamics of nucleosomes. In order to study the role of poly (dA&#903;dT) elements on nucleosomal DNA structure, I investigated the stability and crystal structure of a nucleosome core particle containing a 16 base pair poly (dA&#903;dT) element (A16 NCP). I found that interactions between the nucleosomal DNA ends and the histone octamer were destabilized in A16 NCPs. The A16 NCP was crystallized and the crystal structure was refined at 3.2 Å. This A16 NCP structure revealed that the overall structure was maintained except for some local structural alteration, especially in the poly (dA&#903;dT) region. This study not only demonstrated how incorporation of a specific DNA element can alter nucleosome structure and can further influence gene expression, but has also provided the foundation for further studies by other researchers in the chromatin field. These results were published in Journal of Molecular Biology, a leading journal in the field (Exhibit 10).<br>
<br>
The importance of my discovery is emphasized in the recommendation letters written by experts in the field. For example, Prof. Mattew Rowell of Columbia University stated that “Dr. Shetty's discovery can benefit U.S. medical research and healthcare in national scope. His research discovery has provided a very important evidence for the emerging theory that incorporation of a histone variant into a nucleosome is an alternative way to modulate chromatin structure, in addition to the histone modifications.” Prof. Rowell also stated that "Remarkably, Dr. Shetty discovered that the nucleosome containing histone variant H2A.Bbd possesses a loose structure and protects shorter DNA. This research is important to the understanding of transcription regulation and chromatin dynamics, and was published in EMBO Journal. Papers published in this top journal of biomedical science are critically evaluated for compliance with the following criteria: novelty, broad biological significance, importance to the specific field, and strong evidence for the conclusions that are drawn." (Exhibit 11).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<u>Structural and functional studies of NAP-1 (Nucleosome Assembly Protein 1, Finished at Woody Cancer Center of New York University School of Medicine):</u> This research project was supported by NIH grant RGM067777A. The NAP-1 is an acidic histone chaperone protein and has been implicated in histone transport and chromatin assembly. In this project, I found that NAP-1 reversibly removes and replaces histone H2A-H2B or histone variant dimers from assembled nucleosomes, resulting in active histone exchange. Furthermore, I also discovered that transient removal of H2A-H2B dimers facilitates nucleosome sliding along the DNA. Our research results suggest a novel role for NAP-1 in mediating chromatin fluidity by incorporating histone variants and assisting nucleosome sliding. These important results were published in Journal of Biological Chemistry and have been cited 12 times by fellow researchers (Exhibit 12).<br>
<br>
Also, I studied the reconstitution of ‘hybrid’ nucleosome core particles in this project. It is theoretically possible to have a nucleosome in which only one of the H2A moieties has been replaced by its corresponding variant, resulting in a nucleosome with one (H3-H4)2 tetramer, one major H2A-H2B dimer, and one variant H2A-H2B dimer. To investigate this possibility, I performed salt-gradient reconstitutions with mixtures of (H3-H4)2 tetramer, (H2A-H2B) dimers, and H2A.Z-H2B dimers. I discovered that while all histone H2A variants are capable of forming ‘hybrid’ nucleosomes, the propensity to do so clearly differs between macro H2A, H2A.Z, and H2A.Bbd. My research clearly indicates the possibility that variants may be combined with major-type histone H2A in a single nucleosome, thus generating yet another level of structural and functional heterogeneity. The results of this research were published in Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology, which is a prestigious biomedical journal, and the paper has been cited 9 times by other researchers all over the world (Exhibit 13).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Prof. David Godman, an independent expert and the head of Laboratory of Chromatin Biology at the Boston University, wrote in his reference letter that "Dr. Shetty’s research on the role for NAP-1 in mediating chromatin fluidity is very helpful to my own research in this field. Dr. Shetty has performed cutting edge research and made significant contributions to the chromatin field, and his research will benefit the United States’ healthcare in national scope. He has presented original work at several national and international conferences, such as Keystone Symposia and American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) annual meeting. As an outstanding scientist in the chromatin field, Dr. Shetty has published a number of articles in leading journals providing expert opinions, judgments, and detailed description of experimental methods to the field. Dr. Shetty’s work is thus clinically important in leading up to an early diagnosis of the disease, and the proposed benefit of Dr. Shetty’s employment will be national in scope” (Exhibit 13).</font>

<br>
I am seeking the National Interest Waiver because I can serve the national interest of United States to a substantially better degree than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications. As demonstrated by the submitted documents, I have published excellent articles, and these articles have been widely cited by other researchers in the field. Also, my articles were all published in prestigious and highly selected peer-reviewed journals and peer-reviewed international conferences. For instance, Journal of Molecular Biology and European Molecular Biology Organization Journal only publish articles by top talents in the field.<br>
<br>
Evidence submitted for this criterion also includes a list of 15 publications in my Curriculum Vitae, a recent collected citation search report of 51 independent citations by scientists and researchers all other the world, as well as copies of the title pages for my articles published in leading journals relevant to the academic field. The list of my publications is long, and I have served as first author for most of the papers. (Exhibit 15-23)<br>
<br>
Also, my productivity and the importance of my research work are noted by several professors and independent experts in their recommendation letters written on my behalf. For example, Prof. Joern Wettern, an independent expert from Cornell University School of Medicine, stated in his reference letter that "Dr. Shetty is a well established and productive researcher, as demonstrated by his widely cited papers published in leading professional and international journals." (Exhibit 24)<br>
<br>
As an indication of my exceptional ability in science, I am an active member in good standing of three professional societies. These societies require outstanding achievement of their members and require election or invitation from precursors to full membership. I am a full member of Sigma Xi, a scientific research society, which is one of the oldest and largest scientific organizations in the world. The Sigma Xi has nearly 60,000 members who were elected to membership based on their research potential or achievements. More than 200 members have won the Nobel Prize. The Sigma Xi chapters in North America and around the world provide a supportive environment for interdisciplinary research at universities, industry research centers, and government laboratories. The full membership in Sigma Xi is by nomination, and is only conferred upon an individual who has shown noteworthy achievement as an original investigator in a field of pure or applied science or engineering. This noteworthy achievement must be evidenced by publication as a first author on two articles published in refereed journals, patents, or a thesis or dissertation (Exhibit 25).<br>
<br>
I am also an active member of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), which is the world’s largest and most prestigious professional organization devoted to cancer research. The active membership of AACR is only open to investigators worldwide who have conducted at least three years of research resulting in articles in peer-reviewed publications relevant to cancer and cancer-related biomedical science, or who have made substantial contributions to cancer research in an administrative or educational capacity. A complete application for active membership consists of the official AACR membership application form with all requested information provided, including appropriate signatures of two nominators who are existing active, emeritus, or honorary members in good standing (Exhibit 26)<br>
<br>
Furthermore, I am a regular member of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB), which is a scientific and educational organization with over 11,900 members. The Society's purpose is to advance the science of biochemistry and molecular biology through publication of scientific and educational journals, organization of scientific meetings, advocacy for funding of basic research and education, support of science education at all levels, and promoting the diversity of individuals entering the scientific workforce. The regular membership is only available to an individual who holds a doctoral degree and who has published, since receipt of the doctoral degree, at least one paper in a refereed journal devoted to biochemistry and molecular biology. Moreover, new regular members must be sponsored by one regular member of the society. The application for regular membership needs to be reviewed and approved by the executive officer (Exhibit 27).<br>
<br>
I am also the winner of nationally recognized award for excellence in the field of endeavor. I have been a Higgins Fellow sponsored by the Woody Cancer Center of New York University School of Medicine for the last two years (Exhibit 1). The Higgins Fellow is a highly prestigious and competitive award created
to support the research efforts of promising recent graduates who will receive their postdoctoral training under the guidance of a faculty member of the Woody Cancer Center. The award competition is held once a year to choose the winners. The applicants must have demonstrated productivity in their graduate studies, as illustrated by first-author publications in international peer-reviewed journals. The candidates will be judged on prior productivity and the novelty and potential of the proposed project. The Higgins Fellow receives salary support and fringe benefits at a rate 20% above NIH guidelines. Also, a research allowance of $20,000 per year will be provided to the Higgins Fellow for the purchase of supplies and small equipments, as well as for travel to scientific meetings in the continental of United States.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In summary, I have published excellent articles, and these articles have been widely cited by other researchers in the field. Also, my articles were all published in prestigious and highly selected peer-reviewed journals and peer-reviewed international conferences. In addition, I am the winner of Higgins Fellow for last two years, and I am an active member in good standing of three professional societies, which require outstanding achievement of their members and require election or invitation from precursors to full membership. The submitted persuasive documentary evidence proves that I have made significance contributions in the field, and I can and will serve the U.S. national interest to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications, and also than other individuals having similar credentials in the field.<br>
<br>
<b>4) The petitioner seeking the waiver must persuasively demonstrate that the national interest would be adversely affected if a labor certification were required for the beneficiary<br>
</b><br>
As demonstrated in the above paragraphs, my research work is in an area of substantial intrinsic merit to the U.S. national interest, and I have been leading my projects and play a significant role in these projects. I also published first-authored articles in peer-reviewed prestigious journals and gave presentations in the national and international reputed conferences. The benefits of my work are national and international in scope. Furthermore, I have established a track record of past success and achievements that would provide a strong assurance of future benefits to the United States.<br>
<br>
Currently, I am leading several projects to find the optimization of the method for reconstitution nucleosome core particles from recombinant histones and DNA. The projects I am working on require the person involved with a comprehensive knowledge in biology, medical science, and experiment techniques, and they also require the person involved with strong analytic ability, innovative thinking, and exceptional creativity.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There is no certain way to quantify these requirements and qualifications for my current position.  In another word, the labor certification process does not work for this position since the criteria to qualify for it cannot be quantified. I have PhD degree and extensive research experience in the field. My past track records have demonstrated my outstanding academic accomplishments, exceptional research ability, and innovative creativity.  Through my experience, education and training, I have acquired the research skills that uniquely fit me for this ongoing research and enable me to make an irreplaceable contribution.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The reason I am seeking a National Interest Waiver is based on my research projects which are of great importance in the U.S. national interest – healthcare and people’s life. As shown by the submitted documents and above demonstration, the projects which I am conducting on and my future career in the biomedical research are highly relevant to the national interest of the United States.<br>
<br>
The type of work I am doing requires all of my attention on the research projects, and the constant attention to both my temporary visa status and the long process of labor certification is certainly a distraction from my projects. As a persistent researcher, the granting of my petition for U.S. permanent resident will allow me to continue my vital research and development, and will also help me to obtain even greater achievement in my career. Therefore, my continued efforts in my project will continuously and prospectively benefit the United States. The labor certification process would undermine these important research projects and will cause significant delays, which in turn is not in the U.S. national interest.<br>
<br>
Moreover, in the world of rapidly changing information and technology, the nature of my work requires me to be able to freely communicate and collaborate with other colleagues in the same field nationally and internationally. Also, I should be able to engage in other research and development projects in different laboratories or even in different fields if necessary. The labor certification procedure is lengthy and employer-oriented. So it would limit my research and ability to work only for the sponsored employer, which will impair my academic freedom, scholar communication, and potential job change for better opportunity to serve the U.S. national interest if the labor certificate were required.<br>
<br>
<b>CONCLUSION&nbsp;<br>
</b><br>
My permanent residence in the United States would greatly contribute to the nation's prosperity and the next generation of science and medicine. The attached evidence shows that I come to the United States to work in the area of my expertise, and my exceptional ability and technical skills are essential to the current research projects at the New York University School of Medicine.<br>
<br>
I have played a crucial role in a number of projects supported by National Institute of Health and American Cancer Society, because of my exceptional research ability. I am also the most productive researcher in both my previous research lab at Columbia University and the current research lab at New York University School of Medicine. I have published 15 peer-reviewed papers during my Ph.D. study and my postdoctoral research. Most of them were published in top ranked national and international journals in the field. The fact that I am one of the leading scientists in the chromatin research field is evidently demonstrated by my research results and publications.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Carcinogenesis at Woody Cancer Center, New York University School of Medicine, which is one of the world’s most respected centers devoted exclusively to cancer patient care, research, education and prevention. The Woody Cancer Center now ranks first in the number of grants awarded and total amount of grants given by the National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute, and American Cancer Society. The research program in Woody Cancer Center is considered one of the most productive efforts in the world aimed solely at cancer research.<br>
<br>
The investigation of nucleosomes and chromatin requires theoretical knowledge, practice skill, and careful attention to detail. In all of these areas, I have demonstrated my exceptional research ability. I have became an expert in both knowledge and the techniques used in the field, such as molecular cloning, protein purification, nucleosome reconstitution, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, analytical ultracentrifugation, and x-ray crystallography. I also have the excellent ability to conduct research efficiently by myself or by collaboration when it is necessary. I am also a recipient of highly prestigious award.<br>
<br>
As shown above, I also submitted independent reference letters to demonstrate that other researchers have been paying attention to my work and putting it to use in their own projects. The USCIS has given much weight to independent evaluations in its determination of whether or not the applicant’s work has been particularly significant and influential in the field, because the independent letters of recommendation are evidence that other researchers well outside of an alien applicant’s own circle of collaborators and superiors have followed the applicant’s work with particular interest. In my situation, I have produced research results that the scientific community outside my university and collaborators/superiors deems to be of special significance.<br>
<br>
Presently, I am working in the United States with an H-1B visa. As explained previously, I am an outstanding researcher, and my research can greatly benefit the United States. Thus, my permanent residence in the United States would significantly contribute to United States' next generation of science and medicine, and contribute to the nation's prosperity. Therefore, I am applying for permanent residence in the United States in the EB2 category of National Interest Waiver, with the waiver of Labor Certification. The submitted documents establish my qualification for this immigration category, and I hope that my permanent residence petition will be granted.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Enclosed please find the attached materials listed below in the INDEX TO EXHIBITS. The recommendation letters and correspondences from renowned professors and technical leaders prove that I have exceptional ability and my permanent stay in the United States can be beneficial to the nation from various aspects. Some documents have confirmed the importance of my work and my exceptional performance, and other documents provide proof and recognition of my achievements. I also include Form I-140 petition required fee and
