<p><font size="2" face="Arial">USCIS' Administrative Appeals Office (“AAO”)
is the adjudicating tribunal that sits directly above the four USCIS Service
Centers. AAO has appellate jurisdiction on over 40 different types of
immigration petition including NIW based I-140 petition. When an NIW petition is
denied and an appeal is filed, AAO adjudicates the final ruling on the case.
These decisions provide guidance for immigration officers in the correct
interpretation of immigration law, regulations and policy.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We have conducted a careful analysis of some
typical NIW appeal cases published by AAO. These rulings provide an excellent
overview of the criteria that USCIS considers when adjudicating an NIW
application. The following is an analysis of 5 NIW petitions which were denied
by USCIS Service Centers initially, and also denied by AAO after appeal.</font></p>

<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2">1. AAO Denied - Detailed Case Analysis for a Biochemist</font></b><font size="2"><br>
<br>
This case was originally denied by NSC. The petitioner held a PhD in Biochemistry from Indiana University. The petitioner’s
work focused on cloning and characterizing chemokines, which are small proteins that regulate all leukocyte
chemotaxis. Specifically, the petitioner cloned and characterized two different chemokines that had not yet been cloned.<br>
<br>
AAO upheld NSC’s original denial on several grounds. AAO was not persuaded by the cloning and characterization of the two
chemokines because the petition failed to explain how this alleged achievement constituted more than just applying existing
cloning technology to chemokines that had yet to be cloned, partially because the petitioner was not the first one to clone and
characterize chemokines.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In his Request For Evidence (RFE) response, the petitioner submitted a letter from Amgen Inc. that stated the petitioner had
made valuable contributions to Amgen’s antibody program during a recent collaboration. While any evidence of private industry
utilizing an NIW applicant’s research is usually considered persuasive for showing practical application, AAO noted that it was
unclear whether the petitioner’s collaboration with Amgen occurred before the original submission date and discounted the
letter.<br>
<br>
This brings to the forefront a very important point regarding RFE’s: for any evidence submitted with an RFE, it is important to
indicate the date of the event or achievement. Any evidence, such as new publications or citations must have occurred before
the original filing date of the NIW petition.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Neither the USCIS Service Center nor AAO will consider the evidence in an RFE if there is a possibility it occurred after the
filing date no matter how spectacular the achievement. Thus it is important to clearly show the dates of any new evidence
submitted with your RFE. Otherwise, it could be discounted much like what happened to the petitioner in this case.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#006666"><b>2. AAO
Denied - Detailed Case Analysis for a Economist<br>
</b></font><br>
In this appeal from the California Service Center (CSC), the petitioner held a
MS in Economics from Cornell University. The appeal was denied for many of the same reasons already discussed (i.e. lack of citations, etc.). This petitioner also
participated in review work for peer-reviewed publications; however, in this case, AAO remarked that the petitioner’s
“occasional participation in peer review of this kind does not adequately distinguish the petitioner from other researchers.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
While this appears to contradict some previous opinion on peer-review work, it is still consistent when working from the
premise that peer-review work alone will not qualify an applicant for an NIW. Thus, only if the applicant is already qualified
for an NIW based on other credentials, will peer-review work be considered “influence in the field.” From this, it can be
argued that overall peer review work is not given much persuasive weight, since it is only viewed as “influential” when the
applicant already qualifies for approval.<br>
<br>
The petitioner had an impressive recommendation letter profile, including letters from the Vice President and Head of
Macroeconomic Research at the Federal Reserve Bank, and two United States Congressmen. The appeal was ultimately denied.
Although the recommendation letter authors were impressive when considering title and position, from the letters themselves, it
was clear that they were not familiar with, and did not rely upon petitioner’s work. Thus, simply knowing “big names” and
having them write letters alone is not sufficient to qualify for an NIW. The contents of the letters are just as important as
who is writing them.<br>
<br>
The essential argument in this case was that, because the petitioner managed a large power company that traded millions of
dollars with the U.S., her work should be deemed in the national interest. AAO ultimately denied this case. It compared her
other presidents of large companies in the field and noted that her work was no different than what was expected of any CEO or
President in a similar position. Thus she had failed to demonstrate how her work stood out from a similarly situated U.S.
worker to overcome the labor certification argument. The size or position you hold will not give you an advantage in an NIW
application- as mandated by NIW standards, USCIS will simply compare you against workers who are in the same type of position
in companies of the same size. You still must demonstrate how your work is above that of other similarly situated U.S.
workers.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#006666"><b>3. AAO
Denied - Detailed Case Analysis for a Crytogeneticist<br>
</b></font><br>
This case was originally denied by NSC. The petitioner received her MS in Anthropology from the University of Delhi. Her work
focused on crytogenetics, linking chromosome abnormalities with resulting conditions such as infertility or cancer.<br>
<br>
AAO upheld the denial based on many of the same reasons recounted in the NIW cases. On appeal, the attorney for petitioner
argued that there was a shortage of technicians trained in the petitioner’s field of research. Responding to this argument, AAO
noted that the determination of such worker shortages falls within the jurisdiction of the Department of Labor, and can be
addressed by the Labor Certification process. The petitioner also argued that the labor certification process was too lengthy.
Predictably, this argument was deemed unpersuasive by AAO. National Interest Waivers were not established so that employers&nbsp;could avoid the “inconvenience” of the Labor Certification Process.<br>
<br>
Particularly damaging to this petition, nearly all of the quoted letters of recommendation emphasized the “great potential” of
petitioner’s research work. As we know, such assurances of the future benefit of petitioner’s work are unpersuasive – the
petitioner must demonstrate a history of significant contribution to the U.S. national interest. Even if an applicant has a strong
record of past achievement, any language pertaining to the future potential or expectation of future results, no matter how
great, should be avoided.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A rule of thumb to keep in mind when detailing an NIW applicant’s achievements is to describe the various achievements in the
past tense if possible. This will help avoid any potential confusion of when the USCIS Service Center adjudicates the case.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#006666"><b>4. AAO
Denied: Detailed Case Analysis for an Electrical Engineer<br>
</b></font><br>
The AAO upheld VSC’s denial on several grounds. First, AAO pointed out that most of his recommendation letters were written by
people he had either worked with or studied with, once again illustrating the importance of procuring letters from independent
authors. Second, the petitioner failed to present any evidence of practical applications from his work – bald assertions in the
recommendation letters without any evidentiary basis were considered unpersuasive.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Third, although the petitioner submitted newspaper articles regarding his work, the article did not mention the petitioner by
name and thus were also deemed unpersuasive. Finally, while the petitioner had an extensive publication list of over 27
articles, he failed to present evidence of citations to his published works, which would have demonstrated some degree of
influence on the field as a whole.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This final point is reiterated time and time again in the AAO appeal denials: the number of citations, not publications, is the
determinant factor in some NIW cases. Although citations are especially important they are not necessary for every case.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#006666"><b>5. AAO
Denied: Detailed Case Analysis for a Molecular Biologist<br>
</b></font><br>
This case was originally denied by the USCIS California Service Center (“CSC”). The petitioner in this case received his PhD in
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. His work focused on cancer cell biology.<br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, AAO upheld CSC’s original denial. The petitioner in this case made several classic blunders in his NIW
petition that should be avoided. First, his recommendation letters emphasized his skills in the lab and his education. While
the petitioner’s skill set and education may be relevant in a Labor Certification based EB2 application, but for an NIW based
EB2 case, the applicant must demonstrate a past history of achievement with some degree of influence on the field as a whole.
Letters that focus the petitioner’s skills or “unique abilities” in the lab should be avoided – instead, letters should
emphasize the petitioner’s previous achievements that have influenced the field.<br>
<br>
Second, all of his recommendation letters came from institutions where he had worked – once again reiterating the importance of
finding independent authors for your letters of recommendation.<br>
<br>
Third, AAO noted that two of the recommendation letters contained paragraphs that were completely identical word-for-word. Such
an obvious and careless mistake can be particularly damaging to the credibility of the petition. Each recommendation letter is
supposedly a personalized, testimonial letter from the author who is using his or her specialized knowledge to describe the
national impact of the applicant’s work. By simply having the author sign a copy-and-pasted letter, the credibility of the
entire petition comes into question.<br>
<br>
The AAO went to great lengths to discuss how, by themselves, patent applications and patent grants from the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) were unpersuasive for the purposes of an NIW. The AAO noted statistics from
USPTO, which demonstrated that there were 198,975 patents granted in that year alone. With such a high number of patents granted per year, NIW arguments
based on a Petitioner’s patents are unpersuasive without corroborating evidence demonstrating the inventions are used on a
nationwide scale.<br>
