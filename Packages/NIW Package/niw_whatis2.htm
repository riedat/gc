    <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">1. The Three-Prong Test
    Set Forth in Matter of New York State Department of Transportation&nbsp;</font></b></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The employment-based immigration is one of the most popular ways to obtain U.S.
permanent residency. The EB2 NIW permanent residency process is a two-application process. One application
is called the Form I-140 petition, which is filed for an immigrant visa and can be filed by a U.S. employer, or
it can be self-petitioned
by an alien in the case of National Interest Waiver. The other application
should be filed by an alien, and it is called the Form I-485 application to change his or her status to
a permanent resident of United States.&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There is no statutory standard as to what will qualify an alien for a National Interest Waiver. The
    USCIS considers each case on an individual basis. However, obtaining approvals in
    the NIW category became more difficult as a result of a case known as <b><i> New York State Department of Transportation
    (NYSDOT)</i></b>. USCIS has been scrutinizing the NIW petitions more carefully after
    the NYSDOT case.&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
    Most NIW petitions should argue their qualification around the <b><i>Three-Prong
    Test </i></b> set forth in Matter of New York State Department of Transportation (AAU, 1998):</font></p>

<blockquote>

    <p><font face="Arial"><u><font size="2">1) The alien seeks employment in an area of substantial intrinsic
    merit:</font></u><font size="2"><font color="#006666"> </font>The alien’s employment must be important to the national interests of the United States.  Additionally, the
    benefits of the alien’s employment should be immediately apparent to the national interest of the United States.</font></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial"><u><font size="2">2) The benefits of the alien’s proposed employment must be national in
    scope:</font></u> <font size="2"> The alien’s employment may be limited to a particular geographic area.  However, the petitioner must establish
    that the alien’s employment would benefit other regions of the country as well. Moreover, there would be little
    or no adverse impact on the interests of other regions of the country.</font></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial"><u><font size="2">3) It would be contrary to the national interest to potentially deprive the prospective employer of the alien’s
    service by making available to U.S. workers the position the alien seeks:</font></u><font size="2"><font color="#006666"> </font>There are three elements to this requirement:&nbsp;</font></font></p>

  <blockquote>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(a) the alien will serve the national interest to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S.
    worker having the same minimum qualifications;&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(b) the alien is not seeking a national interest waiver based on a shortage of qualified workers in a given
    field, regardless of the nature of the occupation;&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(c) the petitioner must establish the alien has a past record of specific prior achievement which justifies
    projections of future benefit to the national interest.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font color="#006666">2. The Differences between
the Immigration Categories of &quot;National Interest Waiver&quot; and &quot;Alien of Extraordinary Ability&quot;,
as well as &quot;Outstanding Researcher or Professor&quot;<br>
</font></b><br>
Both NIW and EB1 (EB1-Extraordinary Ability, and EB1-Outstanding Researcher or Professor)
immigration categories are employment-based immigration for
U.S. permanent residency, without the requirement of Labor Certification. They have
similarities, but also have several key
differences.&nbsp;</font>
</p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) The similarities include:&nbsp;</font>
</p>

  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Neither requires a Labor Certification;&nbsp;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Both NIW and EB1 categories require extensive evidence of achievement and
      excellent ability;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Some supporting documentation for each petition is
      similar.&nbsp;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2) The differences include:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">A NIW petition depends more on an alien's
        current research work or projects, so that the alien will serve the U.S.
        National Interest to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S.
    worker having the same minimum qualifications;</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Both EB1-Extraordinary Ability petition
        and EB1-Outstanding Researcher or Professor petition depend more on an
        alien's previous achievements and accomplishments in a field, to prove
        that the alien has &quot;extraordinary ability&quot; or
        &quot;outstanding ability&quot;;</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Both EB1- Extraordinary Ability and EB1-Outstanding Researcher or Professor
        categories generally require
      higher achievement and ability than that required by NIW;&nbsp;</font></li>
    </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The EB1- Extraordinary Ability category can apply to many different
      fields in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, while the
      National Interest Waiver category generally applies to scientific,
      engineering, or scholarly fields;&nbsp;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Both National Interest Waiver and
      EB1-Extraordinary Ability categories require no specific employment or job offer, while the
      EB1-Outstanding Researcher or Professor category requires a job offer for a permanent research
      position or a tenured/tenure track teaching position;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">One can self-petition in the National Interest Waiver
      or in the EB1-Extraordinary Ability
      category without a U.S. employer's sponsorship, while the EB1-Outstanding Researcher or Professor category requires a sponsorship from the alien's employer or prospective employer;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The EB1-Outstanding Researcher or Professor category requires at least three years experience in the field, while the
      National Interest Waiver and EB1-Extraordinary Ability category has no specified minimum experience requirement for any particular field.&nbsp;</font></li>
  </ul>

</p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most applicants know they need help in preparing
    a Green Card petition, but usually they do not know how much help they would need in preparing the supporting documents such as the petition cover letter and the letters of recommendation. The help from our
    <i> Complete Do-It-Yourself Package for National Interest Waiver Petition</i>
    in preparing the petition and the supporting documents are
    essential and critical, and it will save you a lot of time and money. More importantly, it will help you to build a strong foundation for your petition.</font>
</p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Especially for the National Interest Waiver petition, due to the
    U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' strict qualification requirements, a successful applicant can not rely on the general practice to prepare whatever materials
    an alien applicant can come up with, and
    then hope to get a case approval.&nbsp;</font>
</p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Instead, before an alien applicant collects information for his or her case, the
    applicant needs to first carefully analyze the technical background in view of the legal requirements, and develop a clear strategy
    to build a strong case in the National Interest Waiver immigration category. The effective petition requires in-depth and case-specific analyses, according to the methods and strategies provided in our Complete Do-It-Yourself Package for
    National Interest Waiver Petition.</font>
