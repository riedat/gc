    Sir or Madam:</font></span></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I write this letter in support of Dr. Ravi Shetty’s petition for immigration to the United States, in the category of
    EB2 National Interest Waiver. Dr.
    Shetty performed excellent research on structure and function of nucleosomes, and demonstrated his
    exceptional research ability. He has been a critical member of my research group in Edward Cancer Center since January 2006. The work he is doing has very high quality and is also important for improving the quality of health care in America.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    I am presently a Professor in the Department of Carcinogenesis at Edward Cancer Center. I received my Ph.D. degree in Molecular and Cell Biology from Duke University in
    1994. I have been a Principal Investigator for NIH
    (National Institute of Health) and ACS
    (American Cancer Society) sponsored research focused on the role of chromatin remodeling complexes in DNA repair. My research have been published in a number of highly esteemed journals, such as
    <i> Cell, Science</i> and <i>Nature</i>. I have also presented my work at conferences around the world. Additionally, I have served on the peer review board for NIH research grants, and have been invited to review papers for several leading scientific journals including
    <i> Science</i> and <i>Nature</i>. Thus, I believe I am well qualified to evaluate Dr.
    Shetty’s research ability and contributions to the field and its benefits
    to United States' National Interest. Attached is a copy of my Curriculum
    Vitae for your review.<br>
    <br>
    Dr. Shetty is well trained in biochemistry and molecular biology. He received his bachelor degree
    and master degree in India. Dr. Shetty is also well trained in crystallography and biophysics when he conducted his Ph.D. work at Department of Biochemistry at Columbia University in New York city.
    Dr. Shetty has completed cutting edge research and made significant contributions to the chromatin field. He has presented his original work at several national and international conferences, and has published over 12 articles in extremely prestigious international journals including
    <i>Cell</i>. His work has been cited more than 110 times in leading scientific journals throughout the world.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Dr. Shetty has made tremendous contributions in the area of histone variants and nucleosome structures. In eukaryotic cells, such as a human cell, DNA is tightly packed together with proteins into a complex called chromatin, whose structure controls whether the cell can transcribe genes, replicate and repair DNA. The fundamental subunit of chromatin is a nucleosome, which is made up of a disk of histone proteins surrounded by DNA. Dr.
    Shetty’s outstanding skill has led to his successful design and performance of an innovative and landmark study of nucleosome containing histone variant H2A.Bbd.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
    The cutting-edge biochemical and biophysical techniques were used appropriately in this study. Using micrococcal nuclease digestion, Dr.
    Shetty was able to show that only 118 bp DNA is protected in the H2A.Bbd nucleosome. Then, nucleosomal arrays containing H2A.Bbd or conventional H2A were reconstituted and analyzed by in vitro transcription assay. This is an outstanding accomplishment in that Dr.
    Shetty was the first researcher to accomplish this challenging feat. Remarkably, he discovered that the nucleosome containing histone variant H2A.Bbd possesses a loose structure and protects shorter DNA. This research is important to the understanding of transcription regulation and chromatin dynamics, and was published in
    <i>European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) Journal</i>.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Additionally, Dr. Shetty is also an expert in X-ray crystallography, which
    is the most powerful and important technique in protein structure determination. He determined the first crystal structure of
    nucleosome containing a poly(dA.dT) element. This structure model provides insights into how poly(dA.dT) element regulates transcription by altering the overall stability and local protein-DNA interactions of the nucleosome. This model is also the first nucleosome structure with an asymmetric DNA sequence in the world. This beautiful work was published recently in the
    <i> Journal of Molecular Biology</i>, which is another highly appreciated journal in the field.<br>
    <br>
    The research in my lab focuses on a novel and evolutionarily conserved class of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, called the INO80 class. The long-term goal of our research is to understand how chromatin is modified to allow DNA repair to occur in an orderly fashion after DNA is damaged, and how changes in chromatin modification lead to human diseases, such as cancer. Currently, Dr.
    Shetty is working on a project funded by NIH focusing on understanding how chromatin is remodeled by INO80 class upon DNA damage, and how defects in chromatin remodeling might lead to cancer.
    He has set up an elegant in-vitro biochemical assay to monitor the stimulation of ATM kinase activity by chromatin remodelers. Excitingly, his result shows that the kinase activity of purified ATM is increased significantly upon the addition of INO80 class complexes.
    Now, Dr.
    Shetty is collecting more in-vitro biochemical and in-vivo genetic data to interpret this observation. The success of this project will define for the first time the role of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling in the activation of the key signal transducer in DNA damage response.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    These projects are highly significant to the people's health of United
    States and its economy, not only for the particular concerns and interests of agencies such as NIH
    and ACS, but have much wider applications. Dr.
    Shetty's research results will directly contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying
    the carcinogenesis related to DNA damage. Additionally, it will also provide information pertinent to the development of bio-markers for earlier cancer diagnosis and a greater understanding of the molecular changes that occur during the development of cancer, which in turn could lead to the development of cutting-edge
    therapies, which could greatly improve the health care of people in United
    States and in other countries.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Dr. Shetty’s outstanding contributions to the scientific community and its
    benefits to U.S. national interest have been recognized nationally and internationally. He has been elected as a full member of
    <i> Sigma Xi,</i>  which is a leading Scientific Research Society, offered to those who have shown noteworthy achievements as an original investigator in a field of pure or applied science. Dr.
    Shetty is also an active member of <i> American Association for Cancer
    Research</i>, and a regular member of <i> American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular
    Biology</i>. All of these organizations are the leading and prestigious professional associations in the world.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    In summary, I believe that Dr. Shetty is a talented investigator who has made, and will continue to make, substantial contributions to
    health care of people in United States and its economy, and his work is in
    U.S. national interest. I endorse Dr.
    Shetty’s application for U.S. permanent residence status strongly and without reservation. I will be pleased to provide any additional information that might be helpful in your evaluation and approval of this petition.<br>
