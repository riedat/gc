<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Re: I-140 Immigrant Petition in EB2 National Interest
Waiver
for Mr. Kevin Yong</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Officer:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is my pleasure to write this letter in support
of Mr. Kevin Yong’s petition for the National Interest Waiver (I-140) to obtain
permanent resident status in the United States, and also providing the
explanations that his current research and development work is in the national
interest of United States.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I came to know Mr. Kevin Yong’s research work and
his potential ability in my capacity as a Director of EDMS (Electronic Document
Management System) project at GE Power System. Since June 2008, he has been
working on document management automation research and development for
applications in engineering, ISO-9002, and government regulatory compliance, as
a principal investigator.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">GE Power System is the world’s leader in power
system research and design. GE Power Systems concurrently manages many national
and international power engineering projects, which may be located in numerous
foreign countries. The EDMS project at GE is an important research and
exploratory development of automating business processes and managing critical
information.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To meet the industry’s strategic and mission
requirements, such as quick Action Items response and appropriate Vendor
Document (VENDOC) management, effective new process development and algorithm
research are essential. These techniques are used to achieve the goal of having
immediate retrieval capability of document in electronic form directly to an
end-user’s desktop while maintaining document security. Mr. Kevin Yong’s recent
demonstration of VENDOC process in EDMS, having the approval of all evaluation
experts coming from both GE and other organizations, proved his superior
research abilities.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">EDMS research and development is also very
important to the American people and government. In 2005, based on Library of
Congress’ <i>National Digital Library Program</i>, the Digital Library
Federation (DLF) was established by &quot;fifteen of the nation's largest
research libraries and archives to create, maintain, expand, and preserve a
distributed collection of digital materials of our nation’s history and
culture accessible to schools, libraries, and American’s home
everywhere.&quot; In this program, how to maintain and preserve digital
documents and records securely and permanently is a challenging research area. Mr.
Kevin Yong’s current research and development project in the field of
automated document management will have direct and potential contribution to
save our nation’s contemporary and historical information.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">An example that U.S. government agencies can
directly apply Mr. Kevin Yong’s present work is the TVA (Tennessee Valley
Authority) projects at GE, which are design and construction of STAG
combined-cycle power plants at New Johnsonville, TN, and Gallatin, TN. These two
TVA projects are critical to continuous economical development in seven
southeastern states of United Stated for the 21 century. For these TVA
projects, Mr. Kevin Yong’s work made a significant contribution, including
assigning and tracking TVA’s Action Items, providing a timely and complete
Action Item response to TVA, and managing various types of TVA documents inside
EDMS.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The research and development of EDMS will not
only help U.S. companies apply new technologies in their business management and
product manufacturing, but will also help them maintain competitiveness over its
foreign competitors in the international market. As the world’s leader in
power system engineering, GE Power System’s orders increased 120% last year,
which means more jobs for American workers. The contribution of EDMS to GE’s
management efficiency and productivity is widely acknowledged by both the GE
leadership team and academic experts.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mr. Kevin Yong’s research and development work in
EDMS also enables GE Power Systems to keep on being competitive in the global
market, while making their products and services better and faster. According to
GE’s 2010 annual report, &quot;GE Power Systems won $10.5 billion contracts,
and power plant orders increase 120% for the year,&quot; driven by record demand
for gas turbines and maintenance services in the international market. Since
2008, more than 1000 jobs in power system engineering has been brought to U.S.
workers.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mr. Kevin Yong earned his Master degree in
Electrical Engineering from Brown University. Before coming to United
States, he had six years industry experience as a research engineer in
computer-aided design and simulation in China. He has published several papers
in scientific journals and submitted research reports to project sponsors.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mr. Kevin Yong is an accomplished researcher and
developer whose skills and knowledge in EDMS and information technology is in
the national interest of United States. The EDMS research and development is one of the key technological areas
in which the U.S. must dominate in order to maintain the high-tech strength of
the nation in the global market. His continued work in this field and other
related research areas will provide more contributions and prosperity to our
nation. I believe that this letter will serve to strengthen Mr. Kevin Yong’s
case, and that his petition will be granted. If there are any questions, please feel
free to contact me.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sincerely</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jeremy Collins<br>Director of EDMS Project at GE<br>NovaSoft Systems, Inc.</font></p>
