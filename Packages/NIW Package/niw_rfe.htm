Example of a Request For Evidence (RFE) from USCIS</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Question: I am a research engineer and working at
our company's R&amp;D center. I have applied a National Interest Waiver I-140
Form petition about four months ago. But it looks like something did wrong by my
employer hired lawyer, I got a REF letter from USCIS Service Center asking for
more evidence as below:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><u><font size="2" face="Arial">The petition has been reviewed and has been
  found to be deficient. A shortage of qualified workers in a given
field, regardless of the nature of the occupation, does not constitute grounds
for a national interest waiver. Given that the labor certification process was
designed to address the issue of worker shortages, a shortage of qualified
workers is an argument for obtaining rather than waiving a labor certification.</font></u></p>
  <p><u><font size="2" face="Arial">An individual alien could not benefit the national
interest by virtue of engaging in the field or seeking an as yet undiscovered
solution to the problematic issue. The evidence presented does not establish
  that the beneficiary is a researcher who is recognized as outstanding in the
  academic field.</font></u></p>
  <p><u><font size="2" face="Arial">Please describe specifically all of this
  beneficiary's exact prior achievements and how these have influenced his field.
  Provide documentary evidence such as letters from experts attesting to the beneficiary's recognized
  work and the influence in his field.</font></u></p>
  <p><u><font size="2" face="Arial">In order to establish the beneficiary as
  researcher who is recognized as outstanding in the academic field, submit
  additional evidence relating to satisfy and how the beneficiary would qualify
  for the category specified. Please provide evidence of original contributions,
  publications and presentation of research work, so the alien's achievement is
  sufficient to meet the threshold of recognized excellence.</font></u></p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. The Request For Evidence
(RFE) and the Burden of Proving Your Eligibility&nbsp;</font></b>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">For National Interest Waiver Green Card application, the burden of proving eligibility for the benefit
sought remains entirely on the petitioner, and the petitioner has to meet the burden. When your petition has been poorly
documented, you
may get a notice of the USCIS' unfavorable decision, a written statement of the reason for the negative outcome and an explanation of how to appeal.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">As an
alternative, USCIS may request for additional information or<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>called Request For Evidence (RFE), by sending you a letter and a list
of information and documents it needs to determine your eligibility. You must
respond to such a request within the specified time period, or your petition will be decided on the basis of the already submitted
documents.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">When you file a NIW Green Card application, the USCIS examiners
have three choices:&nbsp;</font>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) approve the application, or</font>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) deny the application, or</font>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"> 3) request for additional evidence.&nbsp;</font>
</blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">  When a letter of Request For Evidence
is sent out, the applicant has
certain time to respond.  Responses to an RFE usually rely on legal arguments to a great extent, in addition to new documentary evidence to satisfy the examiner's requests.
Many approved NIW cases start with a RFE.</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3. Understand the Request For Evidence
to Increase Your Chance to Obtain a Green Card</font></b>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">There are a lot of complaints with reference to the significant USCIS delays in sending out Requests for Evidence. The USCIS presumes that it is in the U.S. national interest for most foreign nationals seeking Green Cards to undergo
the Labor Certification. The Labor certification is a competitive recruitment process, where the U.S. employer demonstrates to the U.S. Department of Labor that the employer has not been able to find a qualified U.S. worker to perform the same job duties as the foreign national.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
On the other hand, certain advanced degree professionals or those who are considered "exceptional" and who have demonstrated a significant impact on their selected field, may be eligible for the EB1 or National Interest Waiver (NIW) process.<br>
<br>
From time to time, the immigration community observes that there is an increase in denials of EB1 or NIW cases. Typically, before the USCIS issues a denial in any type of case, it first sends a Request
For Evidence. Receipt of an RFE enables the applicant the opportunity to present additional evidence, for a fair and accurate determination. This procedure is in keeping with the purpose of the EB1
or NIW to create an avenue to obtain permanent resident status for an applicant who demonstrates that her or his work will substantially benefit the U.S.<br>
<br>
In the cases where RFEs are received, the specific requests for documentation have bordered on the bizarre. For example, there was an RFE that the applicant would have to prove that the applicant could not "eventually" train someone else to do their work. Yet we know that any
worker, even an expert, can be replaced "eventually." In fact, every person in the world is ultimately and arguably replaceable, since one could argue that we do not need any more cutting edge research and we can all survive without any new research or development. Such requests have no connection with the intention of the law underlying EB1 or National Interest Waivers.<br>
<br>
Another RFE for an NIW requests evidence that the applicant has obtained awards other than academic awards. That is indeed a strange request, because awards are not one of the mandatory criteria for the NIW category and may arguably be useful to show that a person is "extraordinary." In another case, a candidate's salary was deemed questionably low by the USCIS. But actually, a person's salary is not a criterion for NIW, but rather for the
EB1-Extraordinary Ability process. In NIW cases, requests for evidence of high remuneration are inappropriate.<br>
<br>
There are some cases that the USCIS has been issuing denials without RFEs. Especially frustrating was some petitions that
were summarily denied after waiting for review by USCIS for delayed time period. In other cases, same USCIS Service Center denied the NIW case, but approved EB1-Extraordinary
Ability petition for the same applicant. The denial of the NIW petition stated that the
applicant failed to meet the "exceptional" standard. This appears to fly in the face of reason, when the USCIS admits that the
person satisfied the higher standard of extraordinary ability for the
EB1 petition, but could not satisfy the lower "exceptional" standard for the EB2
petition.&nbsp;Therefore, if a candidate potentially qualifies for both NIW and EB1, it may be worthwhile considering to file in both categories, to
increase the chance of success for getting the Green Card.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">4. The Tips
      for the Request&nbsp;For Evidence</font></b>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The following are tips on
      I-140 RFEs issued by the USCIS:</font>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b><i><font size="2">1) RFE Response
        Deadline:</font></i></b><font size="2"> With rare exceptions, the USCIS
        normally allows more than 30 days from the date the RFE is issued for
        the petitioner to respond. More importantly, it does not permit any time
        extensions. A RFE due date is fixed, and there are no exceptions to this
        rule. If a petitioner fails to respond to a RFE in time, the USCIS will
        usually deny the petition as &quot;abandoned.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <b><i>2) Never Receive the RFE:</i></b> Although it is standard practice
        for the USCIS to send an I-140 RFE to the petitioner, sometimes the
        petitioner never receives the RFE. The first indication of a problem
        then occurs when the petitioner receives a Denial Notice directly. In
        this case, the petitioner can request the USCIS to reopen the case
        because RFE was never received - <i>documentary proof of non-receipt is
        not possible</i>. The USCIS has reopened I-140 cases where the
        petitioner has, in a timely manner, reported the problem to USCIS.<br>
        <br>
        <b><i>3) Sign up with the USCIS Case Status Service:</i></b> In order to
        avoid non-receipt of RFEs, the petitioner should sign up with the <i><b>USCIS
        Case Status Service</b></i> for email notification on petition status
        for the I-140 filed. When an RFE is issued, the online status message
        will be changed to reflect this event, and an email will automatically
        be sent to the petitioner.</font></font>

<blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>This office is unable to complete the processing of your petition without further information. Please read and comply with the
request below, then submit the evidence to the above address. Include a copy of this letter and place the attached gold sheet
on top of your documents.<br>
<br>
The petitioner has filed Form I-40 for an alien applying for a National Interest Waiver who is a member of the professions
holding an advanced degree or an alien of exceptional ability.<br>
<br>
<b>Substantial Intrinsic Merit:</b><br>
<br>
You must establish that your proposed employment has substantial intrinsic merit. You submitted a letter from the Department
of State Health Services and seven letters from friends and colleagues who speak of your employment. However, the evidence on
record fails to show that your proposed employment as a Research Associate is of substantial intrinsic merit. Please submit
evidence to establish that your activities are of substantial intrinsic merit. This evidence might show that the field of
endeavor may:<br>
<br>
 - Benefit the U.S. economy;<br>
 - Improve wages and working conditions of U.S. workers;<br>
 - Improve educations;<br>
 - Provide more affordable housing;<br>
 - Improve the environment of the U.S.;<br>
 - Make more productive use of natural resources, or<br>
 - Serve the interests of a U.S. government agency;<br>
<br>
<b>National in Scope<br>
</b><br>
You have not establish that your proposed employment is national in scope. The signatories of the letters you submitted speak
of the influence that you have in your research projects. However, the evidence on record fails to show that your work will
bring benefits to the United States and that the benefits are national in scope. Please submit evidence that your
contributions will impart national-level benefits.</i></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><i><b>National Interest Waiver</b><br>
<br>
You must establish that the national interest would not be served if you were required to obtain a labor certification for the
proposed employment. You failed to submit any evidence to establish that the national interest would be affected if you were
required to go through the labor certification process. Please submit evidence to establish that your past record justifies
projections of further benefit to the nation. The evidence on record fails to show that you have influenced the field by
acquiring the necessary knowledge or exceptional skills.<br>
<br>
You must persuasively demonstrate that the national interest would be adversely affected if a labor certification were
required. You must demonstrate that it would be contrary to the national interest to potentially deprive the prospective
employer of your service by making the position available to U.S. workers. You must establish that you have a past record of
specific prior achievement with some degree of influence on the field as a whole.<br>
<br>
You must establish, in some capacity, your ability to serve that national interest to substantially greater extent than the
majority of others in the field. For example, you may submit copies of your patents and copyrights; grant proposals; peer
reviewed articles; performance evaluations for the last five to ten years; work that has been evaluated in independent
journals; and awards for work in the field. Any awards for work in the field must be accompanied by a statement form the
institution that granted the award, commenting on the number of awards given, the frequency of the awards, the criteria for
granting the award, and the number of individuals eligible to compete for the award.<br>
<br>
You must submit the requested information before the deadline. Failure to do so  may result in the denial of your petition.<br>
<br>
Please note the required deadline for providing a response to this Request For Evidence (RFE). The deadline reflects the
maximum period for responding to this RFE. However, since many immigration benefits are time sensitive, you are encouraged to
response to this request as early as possible, but no later than the date provided on the request.<br>
