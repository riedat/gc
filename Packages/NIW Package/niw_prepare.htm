an alien applicant can meet its requirements, the National Interest Waiver may be the best choice for

qualification and achievements in a field.</font></span></p>

initial preparatory step takes place before filing the Form I-140 petition based on
the National Interest Waiver.&nbsp;The length of this process varies for different person. Some people
may be ready for filing the Form I-140 in weeks, while others may take several months.<o:p>
</o:p>In the initial preparatory step, an
applicant needs to work on the following issues:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="MARGIN: 11.25pt 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 110%"><font size="2" face="Arial">writing

  <li>
    <p style="MARGIN: 11.25pt 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 110%"><font size="2" face="Arial">preparing
    supporting documents such as diplomas, awards, professional memberships;</font></p>
  <li>
    <p style="MARGIN: 11.25pt 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 110%"><font size="2" face="Arial">collecting

0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:110%"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
reference letters must meet certain requirements. They are not ordinary
recommendation letters for employment purpose. To successfully support a NIW petition, good reference letters are necessary. Some
referrers may
want the applicant to provide a first draft for them to begin with. Generally,
three or more reference letters should be obtained. There is no requirement that
an applicant must have reference letters. But due to the importance of the reference
letters, it has become a recommended practice to obtain three or more of them.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:11.25pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:
0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:110%"><font size="2" face="Arial">A good
reference letter should not simply praise the applicant to meet the requirements in
the NIW category, and such a practice will result in failing to support
crucial legal arguments. Drafting and
revising
reference letters have particular importance, because the contents
of the letters are a significant part of the foundation of a NIW petition.&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p style="margin-top:11.25pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:
0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:110%"><font size="2" face="Arial">You can
    petition for yourself without your current employer's formal sponsorship.
    This means that you are both the petitioner and the beneficiary. In such a
    case,
    you should sign the Form I-140 and the petition cover letter, which should not
    be signed by your current employer; or</font></li>
  <li>

0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:110%"><font size="2" face="Arial">Your
    current employer is the petitioner, and you
are the beneficiary of the petition. Because your employer is the petitioner,
you can prepare all the documents and collect all the evidence, but your
employer needs to sign the Form I-140 and the petition cover letter for you.</font></li>
</ul>
<p style="MARGIN: 11.25pt 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 110%"><font size="2" face="Arial">For
each way of the petition, besides asking people to write reference letters for
you and collect evidence as mentioned above, you may need to have your previous
and current employers to help your petition. Some employers, especially large
companies and major universities, have become experienced and have established a
system to process the NIW petition. These employers may take care of everything
except to find people to write reference letters for you.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 11.25pt 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 110%"><font size="2" face="Arial">However,
in most situations, an employer will not take the responsibility of your NIW
petition.&nbsp;In such a case, your may want to persuade the employer to help
your application. This means that you should do almost everything, and your
employer's involvement includes providing company documents, applicant's
contributions, project and research achievement, recommendation letters, and so
on.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 11.25pt 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 110%"><font size="2" face="Arial">For
most people, it is an advantage to work directly on your own Green Card
application case in NIW category, because much of the process is under your
control, not under your employer or a lawyer's control. If your Green Card
application is totally left to an employer, it may take long time for an
employer to file a Labor Certification application and then file a Form I-140
application (and later found that there are no <span style="COLOR: black">immigration
visa numbers available in EB3 immigration category</span>), when it could be
done by yourself within several months and without the Labor Certification at all. Because
employers usually do not have a motivation to speed up an employee's Green Card
application process.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">3. How to Prepare Your National Interest
Waiver Petition and Build a Strong Case</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In a National Interest
Waiver petition, the emphasis is laid on both of your current work in the U.S.
    national interest and your personal achievements in a field, and to prove that
    you are working in an area of substantial intrinsic merit and your work will benefit the nation as a whole.
    A right approach to define your field and provide evidence for your achievements is the key in a successful
    NIW petition.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As an applicant, you should evaluate your situation as to the NIW option of immigration petition. You may first update your resume and then consider whether the
    NIW category is applicable to your situation. If not, you may consider other immigration classifications
which may be best for you, such as EB1-Extraordinary Ability (EB1A), EB1-Outstanding Researcher or Professor
    (EB1B), or even Labor Certification.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After you choose the National Interest
Waiver classification, you need:</font></p>

    <blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) effectively communicate with your current employer
and/or previous employer to obtain any help for document/evidence collection for your achievements in a field;
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) carefully examine the sample recommendation letters provided in
this package, which can be used as a reference for the initial draft of the
letters of recommendation (or reference letters) for your petition;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">3) review and edit your draft letters of recommendation to ensure that they include the appropriate language and meet the
NIW requirements;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">4) collect all the documents and evidence needed for your
NIW petition;<br>
<br>
5) organize all the required documentation for your NIW petition, including the signed
reference letters;<br>
<br>
6) draft a petition cover letter based on the sample cover letter included in
this package, which explains in detail how you may qualify as an Alien of
Exceptional Ability, and you may serve the national interest to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications, and the national interest would be adversely affected if
you are required for a Labor Certification;<br>
<br>
7) fill and sign the Form I-140, and submit the completed petition materials to
a proper USCIS Service Center, with the required application fee;<br>
<br>
8) contact the USCIS for the status inquiry of your pending case;<br>
<br>
9) if the USCIS makes a request for additional evidence on your pending case, you should respond and submit the additional documentation required for your case to the USCIS in time.&nbsp;</font></p>
