    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
    The Employment-based Second Preference (EB2) immigration category involves members of the
    professions who hold advanced degrees and individuals of exceptional ability in the
    sciences, engineering, business, or arts. Although this category generally requires an employer's
    sponsorship and Labor Certification,
    the Unites States Attorney General may waive these requirements if an alien
    applicant's work is in the United States National Interest.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since 1990, the Immigration Act has provided that an alien of exceptional ability may obtain a "waiver of job offer" if such waiver
    is deemed to be in the &quot;National Interest.&quot; It applies only to professionals holding advanced degrees and exceptional ability aliens. In fact, the
    regulations provide that a waiver of a job offer also includes a waiver of the
    Labor Certification requirement. The petitioner may file Form ETA-750, Part B, or Form ETA-9089, in duplicate, in support of the
    Form I-140 petition. Either form is
    acceptable.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The National Interest Waiver (NIW) is the best choice for those
    aliens who do not wish to wait a long time for Labor Certification process, and those aliens who do not want to be limited to a specific employer
    during
the long Green Card application process. Also, an alien applicant does not need
    to have a
permanent job offer in the United States to apply for a Green Card in this
    category.&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The National Interest Waiver Green Card
    petition can either be filed by
    an alien applicant, or can be sponsored by a U.S. employer. An alien applicant may
    also file additional Green Card applications in other categories, while a National Interest Waiver petition is pending.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In order to file a National Interest Waiver
    petition, an alien applicant's work must benefit the U.S. National Interest. Since the term
    &quot;National Interest&quot; has not been defined in the statute by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
    Services (USCIS), certain factors are taken into account in determining the national interest. These factors include
    improvement of the U.S. economy, wages and working conditions for U.S.
    workers, education, health care, the environment, and housing.</font></p>

<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. The Advantages of National Interest Waiver
Immigration Petition</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The most notable advantage for those who qualify for an
EB2 NIW petition is the lack of a Labor Certification requirement. The National Interest Waiver
is one category of applying for the U.S. Green Card by which the cumbersome application procedure of
    Labor Certification is bypassed.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> The Labor Certification usually is a prerequisite to get
    U.S. Green Card via second preference EB2 or EB3 employment, and has to be applied from the
U.S. Department of Labor. If
    an alien is providing or will provide the services that fall into the U.S.
    National Interest categories, the alien may apply for U.S. Green Card through
    the NIW, which means an alien applicant does not need a Labor Certification and
    does not need a job offer of employment. Therefore, it may save a
considerable amount of time and allow&nbsp;
    an alien applicant to not be tied to a specific employer.&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Obtaining a Labor Certification
can be a time-consuming and expensive process that seeks to determine whether a qualified U.S. worker is available to fill the position sought by the petitioning alien. In addition to the time and expense
    required by the Labor Certification process, an alien risks being denied a Labor Certification if a U.S. worker with technical qualifications for the employment is found, even if the alien is actually more suitable for the position based on factors not considered in the Labor Certification process.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In an EB2-based NIW petition, the Labor Certification is not required at all.
Also for NIW petition, a permanent job offer is not required, and an alien may petition immigration by himself or
herself without a U.S. employer's sponsorship.
But for Labor Certification based petitions, a permanent job offer is required, and a U.S. employer must be the petitioner.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In summary, the advantages of National Interest Waiver
    petition include:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">No need for a permanent job offer of
    employment;&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">No need for labor certification;</font></li>
    </ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">No need to be tied to a specific employer during
    the whole Green Card application process;</font></li>
</ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The NIW belongs to the second preference
        EB2 employment-based
    immigration, the immigrant visa number waiting time is much shorter,
        sometimes several years shorter, than the EB3 based immigration
        application (often, the immigration
visa numbers in the EB3 category are not available or not "current", after aliens obtain their Labor Certification.)</font></li>
    </ul>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">3. The Seven Factors for a National Interest
Waiver Petition</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Section 203(b)(2) of the Immigration Act requires that all aliens seeking to qualify as having exceptional ability show that their
presence in the United States would substantially benefit prospectively the national economy, cultural or educational
interests or welfare of the United States, and adds the additional test of "national interest" to those who wish the job
offer waiver.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Neither Congress nor USCIS defined the term "national interest" in either the
Immigration Act or the regulations, in order to leave the application of this test as flexible as possible. However, an alien seeking to meet the national
interest standard must show significantly more than "prospective national benefit" required of all aliens seeking to
qualify as having exceptional ability. The burden rests with the petitioner to establish that exemption from, or waiver
of, the job offer requirement will be in the national interest. Each case is to be judged on its own merit.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">An alien may apply for U.S. Permanent Residence status
(or Green Card) and seek a waiver of Labor Certification by
    establishing that his or her admission to permanent residence would be in the
    U.S. National Interest. To qualify for National Interest Waiver immigration,
an alien should hold an advanced degree and possess exceptional ability in the sciences,
engineering, business or arts. The USCIS Appeals Board issued a decision that sets forth a number of
    factors upon which the &quot;National Interest&quot; can be determined.
    These factors are:</font></p>

<blockquote>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) <u>	Improving the U.S. economy;</u></font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) <u>	Improving wages and working conditions of U.S. workers;</u>&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">3) <u>	Improving education and training programs for U.S. children and
    under-qualified workers;</u>&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">4) <u>	Improving health care;</u>&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">5) <u>	Providing more affordable housing for young and/or older, poorer U.S. residents;</u>&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">6) <u>	Improving the environment of the United States and making more productive use of natural resources;</u> or&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">7) <u>	A request from an interested U.S. government agency.</u>&nbsp;</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">While satisfying any one of these factors should be sufficient, a discussion of as many of these
factors as
possible makes a stronger application. These factors are not exclusive, and other factors can
also be presented
to USCIS, if they can be shown to be in the National Interest.</font></p>
