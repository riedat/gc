    <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">1. Always Try to Link Your
    Case to the Seven Factors Suggested by USCIS</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A person qualifies for NIW if he or she holds
    an advanced degree and is considered possessing exceptional ability in the
    sciences, engineering, business or arts. While the USCIS has not established
    specific criteria for approving NIW petitions, the USCIS Administrative
    Appeals Office (AAO) suggested that the following seven factors could be
    taken into consideration:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1. improving the U.S. economy;<br>
      2. improving wages and working conditions of U.S. workers;<br>
      3. improving education and training programs for U.S. children and
      under-qualified workers;<br>
      4. improving health care;<br>
      5. providing more affordable housing for young and/or older, poorer U.S.
      residents;<br>
      6. improving the environment of the U.S. and making more productive use of
      natural resources;<br>
      7. a request from an interested U.S. government agency or improving
      international cultural understanding.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Although they are not exhaustive, it is
    always wise to try to link a case to these factors. If there is a good fit
    with the standards, be sure to emphasize it. If an USCIS adjudicator can
    relate to and appreciate the importance of the alien's work, the petition is
    more likely to be approved.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">2. Be Sure to Meet the Three-Prong Test
    for NIW Eligibility of the NYSDOT Case</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The National Interest Waiver
    provisions of the EB2 immigrant visa are intended to be difficult to prove.
    This visa classification is reserved specifically for foreign nationals who
    exhibit exceptional ability and U.S. national interest in their field of
    endeavor. However, recent RFE decisions by the U.S. Citizenship and
    Immigration Services (USCIS) indicate that the exceptional ability and
    national interest requirements for the EB2-National Interest Waiver
    classification are being interpreted even more strictly.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Based on a precedent case commonly referred
    as <a href="niw_nysdot1.htm" target="_blank"><font color="#006666">&quot;Matter of New York State Department of Transportation
      (NYSDOT)&quot;,</font></a>
    the USCIS has re-defined the standards it upholds when evaluating National
    Interest Waiver petitions. These standards include several criteria that
    must be met by any applicant applying for a National Interest Waiver. These
    requirements are called <b><i>Three-Prong Test</i></b> for NIW
    eligibility:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1.It must be shown that the alien seeks
      employment in an area of substantial intrinsic merit.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">2.It must be shown that the proposed
      benefit will be national in scope.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">3.It must be persuasively demonstrated that
      the national interest would be
      adversely affected if a labor certification were required for the alien,
      and the alien applicant should serve
      the U.S. national interest substantially greater than the other equally
      qualified U.S. workers.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first request asks for practical
    application of the area of expertise of the applicant. The second requires
    that applicant must demonstrate that he/she can serve the nation as a whole
    rather than a local area. The biggest problem lies with the third
    request, which asks the applicant to establish why he or she should not go
    through the traditional Labor Certification process.&nbsp;This requirement
    directly contradicts congressional intent when Congress passed the section
    of the law on national interest. Nevertheless, meeting these standards is
    crucial to a successful NIW petition.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The USCIS has made it clear that
  for an alien applicant to show exceptional ability and U.S. national interest
  in the field of endeavor, merely meeting the the basic requirements of NIW
  petition may not be enough to ensure an NIW
  approval. The alien applicant must prove
  himself or herself to be &quot;<i>employed in an area of substantial intrinsic
  merit</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>the employment should be national in scope.</i>&quot; Also,
  comprehensive documentation must be provided to substantiate acclaims to the
  exceptional ability. USCIS is very careful about the forms and sources of
  documentation, and the extent to which it establishes that the alien applicant
  can meet the <u><i>Three-Prong Test</i></u> for NIW eligibility.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3. Since the Labor Certification also Serves the U.S. National Interest,
  the Alien Applicant Must Show How to Serve the National Interest to a Substantially Greater
  Degree<br>
  </font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
  EB-2 makes visa numbers available to persons of exceptional ability and to members of the professions with advanced degrees. To qualify in this category, applicants normally must have a job offer from a U.S. employer who needs their exceptional ability or professional skills. In turn, the employer then has to get a certification from the Department of Labor (DOL) that qualified U.S. workers are unavailable for the job. But the USCIS can waive the job offer, and therefore the labor certification, on grounds of national interest. <br>
  <br>
  With a growing sense that the national interest waiver had become too big an umbrella for a limited exception, the USCIS published a precedent decision,
  <i> Matter of N.Y. State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT)</i>. For the first time, translated "national interest" into a set of conceptual guidelines. One of the 3 tests is specific to the immigrant, and introduces a novel concept:</font></p>

    <blockquote>
  <p align="left"><u><font size="2" face="Arial">"The labor certification process exists because protecting the job opportunities of U.S. workers having the same objective qualifications as an alien seeking employment is in the national interest. An alien seeking an exemption from this process must present a national benefit so great as to outweigh the national interest in the labor certification process."</font></u></p>

    </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For this test, NYSDOT's request for a waiver failed. Although agreeing that the state's engineer was eminent and played a significant role in maintaining New York's highways, the USCIS effectively held that the alien applicant was not influential enough in his field to benefit the national interest. For example, USCIS points out that he trained in a certain new technological method, he did not design it. The
  Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) decision carefully notes that while innovation may be a significant factor, it is not always enough.<br>
  <br>
  In NYSDOT's discussion of the third test for the national interest waiver, the AAO dismissed the claim that this Civil Engineer was needed to ameliorate a critical labor shortage, in view of the availability of the labor certification process to test and accommodate that very claim.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  USCIS recognized that the labor certification process is an imperfect measure. The regulations of the Department of Labor only permit the certification application to test whether there are U.S. workers who have the basic qualifications for the job. The availability of a single U.S. worker who meets the minimum job requirements will defeat the labor certification and thereby deprive the potential employer of the immigrant's services, no matter how outstanding that immigrant may be. <br>
  <br>
  In reconciling these points, the NYSDOT decision would permit the waiver only if the petitioner establishes that
  <i> "the alien will serve the national interest to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications."<br>
  </i><br>
  NYSDOT goes beyond the comparative standard, however, by stating that the benefit to an immigrant's endeavor "must greatly exceed the achievements and significant contributions'" that an immigrant needs to establish "exceptional ability." It imposes this standard whether the immigrant seeks to qualify on the basis of exceptional ability or simply an advanced degree. </font></p>

  <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#006666">4</font></font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font color="#006666">. Evaluate Your
    Case Carefully, and Persuasive Arguments
    Need to be Presented</font></b></font></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The NIW</font></span>
<font size="2" face="Arial">
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">category
is meant to be restrictive. Not everyone has exceptional ability. The USCIS
has been restrictive in its interpretation of the NIW regulations.
Well-crafted advocacy, however, can defend an NIW petition. More is not
necessarily better. Sometimes petitioners submit mountains of documents
arbitrarily, but busy USCIS adjudicators can be overwhelmed and annoyed by
unnecessary bulk.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Therefore, you should evaluate your case
carefully. You may want to discuss the standard with your employer or friends,
and if possible, with your supervisor or mentor, to evaluate whether the
National Interest Waiver classification applies and whether the necessary evidence can be gathered. Detailed initial intakes will help manage expectations, avoid delays due to
Request For Evidence (RFE), and reduce the chance of a denial. Careful analysis not only weeds out weak
case, but also may help identify your accomplishments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since the USCIS has not created checklists, the examiner
must be persuaded that your case has merit. If the argument is
too long and boring, the examiner will lose interest before
understanding the merits of the case. If the argument is too
short and unconvincing, the examiner will not be persuaded. A successful case strikes the right balance between sufficient
detail and argument to establish eligibility, without unnecessary
repetition or the inclusion of irrelevant facts or arguments.
More than any other types of cases, this kind of petition is won or lost
on the strength of the arguments presented. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">You
need to explain how you have performed well beyond what is normally required of
others in your position.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

    <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">5. Be Selective and
    Include Strong Evidence</font></b></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In an attempt to crack down on what it
    perceives as abuse of the NIW category, in addition to the list of seven
    factors deemed to be in the national interest of the U.S., the USCIS
    proposed the following conditions to the regulations for NIW:</font></p>

    <ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">There is a genuine need for the
        skills/experience of the alien. In other words, the alien is not being
        hired to merely overcome labor shortage in a particular under-served
        geographical area, which is viewed by the USCIS as benefiting a smaller
        section of society.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The alien will play a leading or critical
        role in the activity/event intended to benefit the U.S.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The prospective benefit to the U.S. on
        account of the alien's work must be substantial.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is advisable for applicants to include
    satisfactory evidence demonstrating that they meet these conditions.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Also, as a practical matter, include only the first two pages of each journal publication, and the first few pages of each
    reference letter writer’s CV. For example, each publication and each CV could be 10 pages long, which can make the package quite unwieldy.
USCIS examiners are not impressed by the volume of material submitted; in fact,
an examiner might be more likely to set aside a particularly large submission in favor of a shorter one. Be selective and include only
strong evidence. Do not “pad” the petition with documentation that does not clearly make your point.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">6. If It Is Possible, File
    Your Petition with a Specific Job Offer Which Clearly Describes the Work that
    Will be Done&nbsp;</font></b></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Technically, a job offer is not required for
        a NIW petition. For
this reason, it is possible for intending immigrants to
self-petition. The way the law is drafted, it is the job offer that is waived.
        Because the job offer is waived, the individual Labor Certification
        requirement is also waived. Realistically, however, a person seeking a
        NIW must offer persuasive evidence that he or she will be engaged in
        work that will benefit the national interest of the United States. The
        easiest way to do this is with a specific job offer, which clearly
        describes the work that will be done.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As stated in USCIS regulations, <i> "No offer of employment required. Neither an offer for employment in the United States nor a labor certification is required for this classification."</i> However, the petition must be accompanied by clear evidence that the alien is coming to the United States to continue work in the area of expertise. Such evidence may include letters from prospective employers, evidence of prearranged commitments such as contracts, or a statement from the beneficiary detailing plans on how he or she intends to continue his or her work in the United States.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even though USCIS may waive the requirement for you to have current employment, that
        does not mean that a job is not important. In fact, you should always
        state in your petition any kind of relevant job that your currently have, and indicate that your future goal is to dedicate your
        exceptional ability to the
benefits of this country. Having a job guarantees that you are capable of supporting yourself, and that you are using the
        exceptional capabilities that you are claiming in your application.</font></p>

<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">7. Discuss the Economic
Benefits of Your Work</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You may need to discuss the economic benefits of
your work, if applicable. For medical researchers, economic statistics can be
discussed together with human suffering from conditions which you study. Also, y<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">ou
may want to stress the social importance of your work. For example, experience
has shown that if an applicant’s work may be tied to some medical breakthrough
or a significant national social or political benefit, the </span>National
Interest Waiver petition<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">  was more
likely to be granted.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Above all, remember that the USCIS examiners are human being, so there is some information which will have a stronger psychological impact than other information. Trial lawyers talk about "jury psychology", and here you can think the “examiner psychology.” Make the examiners realize that your work is important and that they can feel good about approving your
case.</font></p>

    <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">8. If It Is Possible, Seeking
a Recommendation Letter From a Ranked Governmental Official</font></b></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> If it is possible, you should seek
    recommendation letters from ranked governmental officials. A ranked governmental official is the best person
to write a recommendation letter for you, because this kind of letter would
imply that his/her agency would be benefited from your work directly or
indirectly. However, it is hard for a person to write a good
recommendation letter for you if he or she doesn’t know you or your work.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When collecting evidence, recommendation
    letter (or reference letters) submitted by other experts in the field should be carefully screened for statement
and implication. The letters should clearly support the specific claimed criterion. The petitioner should work with people writing
    the reference letters, review the letters before they are finalized, and ask the writers to revise the letters if necessary.&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">9. This is the Wrong Time to be
    Humble about Yourself</font></b></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
        Keep in mind that you are making a case which sets you apart from the rest of your peers. Therefore, the evidence that you present with your application should clearly set you apart from others in your field.
        You should always present the strongest case possible. This is the wrong time to be humble about your achievements.
        The USCIS adjudicating officer will be looking for exceptional ability which sets you apart from your
        peers, so you should clearly say that your abilities are above the average.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Therefore, you should not use humble words. For example, if your job responsibilities could be that of a
        &quot;Visiting Scholar&quot;, or a &quot;Research Scholar&quot; , or a &quot;Research Scientist&quot;,&nbsp;
        or
        &quot;Lab Technician&quot;, do not claim to be the &quot;Lab
        Technician&quot;.
        The "Research Scientist" or &quot;Research Scholar&quot; sounds much better.
        Also, a &quot;Lab Technician&quot; or &quot;Teaching Assistant&quot; is very hard to claim to have
        &quot;Exceptional Ability&quot;; think of other names which give you a better title, but at the same time does not distort the nature of your job. Please keep in mind that giving incorrect evidence may seriously harm your application, and can be detrimental to any of your future applications too.</font></p>
