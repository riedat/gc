    </font></b><br>
    From fighting cancer to assuring food is safe to protecting our borders, nuclear physics impacts
    the lives of people around the globe every day. In learning about the nucleus of the atom and the
    forces that govern it, scientists develop a depth of knowledge, techniques and remarkable research
    tools that can be used to develop a variety of often unexpected, practical applications. These
    applications include devices and technologies for medical diagnostics and therapy, energy production
    and exploration, safety and national security, and for the analysis of materials and environmental
    contaminants. Nuclear physics and its applications fuel our economic vitality, and make the world
    and our lives safer and healthier, and it can greatly benefits the national
    interests of United States.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#006666"><b>2. What is Nuclear Physics?<br>
    </b></font><br>
    Nuclear Physics is an important pursuit because of the study of the nucleus of the atom is the heart
    of our ability to understand the universe. It provides answers and expands our knowledge of both<br>
    the infinitely small and the extremely large. For instance, we have learned that the nucleus exists as
    a result of relatively simple interactions between subatomic particles known as quarks and gluons.
    And that these particle form a complex system of incredible richness and diversity that makes it
    possible for us, our world and our visible universe to exist. But there’s still much to learn about
    these particles and the forces influencing them.<br>
    <br>
    In pursuit of this knowledge, nuclear physicists probe nuclei with complex devices called
    accelerators, gather information from the probes with sophisticated detector systems, and record and
    analyze that information through advanced computing. They then share what they’ve learned
    concepts, tools and techniques - with many others, including cosmologists and astronomers seeking
    to understand the origins and workings of the universe, and those studying complex systems and
    emergent phenomena in biology. Pursuing this knowledge leads to benefits that are difficult to
    predict. Likewise, many outcomes and possible applications resulting from this pursuit cannot be
    imagined at this time. If the past is an indication, the benefits to society will be many and life
    changing.<br>
    <br>
    <b><font color="#006666">3. Improving Our Health<br>
    </font></b><br>
    The link between medical and nuclear physics research may be a surprise to many. Yet, for more
    than a century, the medical field has looked to nuclear physics for new discoveries and practical
    applications for finding the source of illness and improving treatment. Today, nuclear medicine is an
    essential part of modern healthcare strategies, both for diagnosing and treating illness, particularly
    cancer and heart diseases. Medical imaging techniques, notably single photon emission computed
    to mography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), have their roots in discoveries made
    by nuclear physicists. These technologies use radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals - chemicals
    ”tagged” with radioactive elements that help doctors see inside the body and/or target particular
    cells - which also sprang from nuclear physics research.<br>
    <br>
    More than 10,000 hospitals worldwide use these imaging techniques. In the U.S., there are some 18
    million nuclear medicine procedures per year, and about 10 million in Europe, with use worldwide
    growing at more than 10 percent a year. PET isotopes have helped reveal how addictive drugs affect&nbsp;
    the brain and are being explored as imaging agents to identify hypoxic (oxygen-deficient) tissues in
    patients following a heart attack or stroke. Organ-specific PET imagers have been developed that
    improve the sensitivity of detectors of certain type of tumors, resulting in earlier detection of disease
    and more effective treatments. Recently, doctors have begun using PET scans to reliably diagnose
    the presence of Alzheimer’s disease in those with memory problems.<br>
    <br>
    Other recent medical advances derived from nuclear physics include particle beam therapy for cancer
    treatment, which has evolved from pilot projects at nuclear accelerator facilities to dedicated
    operations at medical centers and to dual-purpose facilities for physics research and oncology. Particle
    beam therapies kill cancer cells more effectively than conventional radiation treatments. They use
    a range of particles - from electron and nuclei (such as protons, helium, carbon) and pi-mesons,
    produced by an accelerator and transported by a system of magnets, to neutrons, produced by
    radioactive elements and special equipment or by accelerators. Other medical imaging techniques
    also have roots in nuclear physics research. These diagnostic technique, including computed axial
    tomography (CAT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have a critical role in providing effective
    medical care.<br>
    <br>
    Additionally, researchers are applying their knowledge and capabilities to help the medical field
    of longer-lasting artificial hips. About 200,000 hip joint replacement surgeries are done each year,
    with a typical replacement hip lasting 10-20 years before wearing out. Nuclear physics researchers
    are helping to conduct wear studies to develop more dual materials.<br>
    <br>
    <b><font color="#006666">4. Making the World Safer<br>
    </font></b><br>
    To conduct their research, nuclear physicists develop detectors to identify, track and provide many
    other details about subatomic particles, such as those produced by particle accelerators. This capability has enabled nuclear scientists to contribute to a broad range of national security capabilities
    and applications. For instance, nuclear physicist are working to make air travel safer. When you
    travel by air today, you are restricted in the liquids you can bring. This is because current X-ray
    machines cannot distinguish between being and hazardous liquids. Nuclear scientists are working
    to provide a better screening device.<br>
    <br>
    Nuclear scientists play an important role in deterring the use of nuclear weapons and dirty bombs
    by identifying the source of a potentially hazardous materials. These scientists use their knowledge
    to identify new detection signatures for nuclear materials or chemical explosives. Additionally, they
    support the work of assessing and certifying the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear
    stock pile. Intercepting smuggled materials or other contraband at national borders is another concern.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Department of Homeland Security wants an infallible method for verifying that large shipping
    containers and trucks are safe, and do it quickly without interrupting commerce. Nuclear resonance
    fluorescence (NRF) may provide a solution. It’s a way of detecting the unique set of nuclear
    ”fingerprints” produced when specific high-energy gamma rays are absorbed and re-emitted by certain
    materials.<br>
    <br>
    <b><font color="#006666">5. Electricity, Environment, Archaeology...</font></b><br>
    <br>
    As the nation prepares for a sustainable energy future, more attention is being focused on nuclear
    energy. For almost 60 years, nuclear energy has helped the U.S. meet its electricity needs, providing
    about 20 percent of electric power. With growing demand for environmentally friendly, non-carbon
    emitting technology, nuclear power is likely to have an even bigger future role. To reduce the
    potential of nuclear proliferation, scientists around the world are also exploring a method for using
    particle accelerators to create the fission that produces electricity, but with materials that do not
    create, as a by-product, bomb-grade material. So-called accelerator-driven systems (ADS) offer
    the possibility of producing electricity with increased safety and flexibility. Other research includes
    neutron beams and state-of-the-art detectors to improve our understanding of nuclear systems and
    constrain costs.<br>
    <br>
    Scientists are also using tools of nuclear physics to explore the effects of rising carbon dioxide
    (CO2) and improve the prospects for harnessing energy in the form of biofuels. For example, plant<br>
    researchers are using positron emission tomography (PET) to track the movement of carbon and
    other nutrients through plants to understand how rising CO2 affects plants physiology, and to learn
    how potential biofuel-producing plants can be optimized to take advantage of additional Co2. Even
    archaeologists benefit from nuclear physics techniques: At the Research Laboratory of the French
    Museums, located within the louvre, archaeologists used accelerator-based studies to classify the
    paint recipes of 12,000-year old cave paintings, leading to a more accurate chronology of the cave
    art.<br>
    <br>
    <b><font color="#006666">6. Better Computers<br>
    </font></b><br>
    Nuclear physics research has stimulated the computer industry. In order to conduct experiments
    to make theoretical predictions, nuclear physicists are pushing the envelope of high-performance
    computing. They are helping to build powerful machines with supercomputer-style processor speeds
    to collect and analyze data, but without the supercomputer-style price tag. When major computer
    corporations wanted to build the fastest computer in the world, they turned to scientific users
    of massively parallel computers: the theorists trying to solve the equations of nuclear physics to
    better understand the evolution of the universe, supernova explosions and gamma-ray bursts. The
    computational techniques used to address these complex physics problems are now applied to other
    complex problems, such as climate modeling and predicting protein structures.<br>
    <br>
    Sophisticated computer simulation codes that were born in the basic physics research community also
    have become industry standards for modeling particle interactions in bulk materials, and in helping
    companies improve equipment prototyping and design. yet another application involves satellites,
    which depend on the reliability of advanced computer chips. These chips, whether in Earth orbit
    or on distant space missions, are constantly exposed to damaging cosmic rays. Using accelerators
    developed for nuclear physics research, specialists can test the chip’s response to radiation before
    they are sent on space missions, allowing changes to be made to increase reliability.<br>
    <br>
    <b><font color="#006666">7. Contributions to Industry<br>
    </font></b><br>
    Radioisotopes developed, studied or produced by nuclear physicists have found their way into our
    homes and a variety of industries. To name a few:</font></p>

          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Americium is used in smoke detectors you buy at the local hardware store, to ensure uniform
            thickness in rolling processes like paper production, and to help determine where oil wells should be<br>
            drilled.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Californium helps scan luggage for hidden explosives and gauge moisture content of soil in the
            road-construction and building industries.</font></li>

          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Cesium is used as a thickness gauge in steel production, and to measure and control the liquid
            flow in oil pipelines.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Cobalt irradiation helps to sterilize surgical instruments and keep our food supply safe.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Iridium is used to test the integrity of pipeline welds and also in irradiation of tumors.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Thorium helps fluorescent lights last longer.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Spacecraft benefit from isotopes such as plutonium, which supplies power needed especially when
            the spacecraft is far from the sun.</font></li>
        </ul>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Refrigeration technologies first developed to operate superconducting particle accelerators, which
    must be kept super-cold, are now available for commercial use. NASA uses similar processes to
    replicate the super-cold conditions in space for equipment testing. The ability to control and focus
    protons and the detector technology designed to monitor them have allowed researchers to develop
    an imaging technique that uses protons, rather than X-rays, for more penetrating power. Using
    proton radiography, researchers can therefore record more detailed information on the motions and
    densities of materials than was ever possible before. Other industrial uses for proton radiography
    include studying coolant flow in automobile engines and the pattern of energy dispersal from high
    explosives, as well as the capability to image components inside massive machinery.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Accelerators are also used to aid in the production of very small pore filters for applications such as
    water filtration, filtering of small molecules, proteins, and viruses. This material is also used as a
    substrate for tissue growth where nutrients can pass through the material to nourish the tissue but
    the pores are too small for the tissue to grow into.<br>
    <br>
    <b><font color="#006666">8.Training the Next Generation of Innovators</font></b><br>
    <br>
    The Office of Nuclear Physics within the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Science has a long
    and productive partnership with universities and provides education opportunities and support to
    university professors and students associated with its basic nuclear physics research. More than 500
    DOE-supported researchers have earned Ph.D.s over the past five years. These students get most of
    their hands-on experience, in both basic and applied areas, at national laboratories predominantly
    supported by DOE Nuclear Physics.<br>
    <br>
    One-third of these highly educated people go on to work in government service or at national research
    labs, another third join science and technology industries, and the final third go on to educate and
    train the next generation of skilled workers and conduct research in academic environments. As the
    examples presented here attest, this educational pipeline further fuels our economy through work
    in fields as diverse as national security, medicine, energy generation, space exploration, and more.</font></p>
