      The NIW &quot;Outweigh&quot; Requirement</font></b>
</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">The significant benefit derived from the alien's participation in the national interest field should considerably outweigh the
      national interest in using the Labor Certification process: The National interest would be adversely affected if a Labor
      Certification were required for the alien. <b><i> Under a NIW, an alien who seeks an exemption from the job offer requirement must be
      able to demonstrate that the benefit his or her activity would provide to the nation is so great as to outweigh the nation's
      interest inherent in completion of the Labor Certification process.&nbsp;</i></b>
      </font>
</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">One of the primary reasons why some petitioners fail in their NIW applications is because they lack a clear understanding of the
      “outweigh” requirement that USCIS applies to NIW cases. The key to a successful NIW application is to directly address the concerns of
      this standard and convince USCIS that you deserve a waiver for the labor certification. Below are some key points on how our
      office addresses this very important issue.
      </font>
</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">An NIW Applicant is required to show that the benefit from his or her work will
      “<i><b>significantly outweigh</b></i>” the national interest of protecting American workers through the labor certification process. You must establish that you will serve the national interest
      to a substantially greater degree than an available U.S. worker having the same qualifications. The most direct and convincing
      way to establish this threshold is to demonstrate that you have already significantly influenced your field of endeavor.&nbsp;
      </font>
</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">Consequently, your NIW
      petition letter should be aimed at demonstrating your previous achievements and recognition for your work
      - you must show a “significant history of prior achievement.” Keep in mind that the standard here is actual practical achievement
      and NOT potential achievement.

      A Case Analysis of NIW &quot;Outweigh&quot; Requirement</font></b>
</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><b><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Example:</font></i></b><font size="2" face="Arial">
      Dr. Sam has just graduated with a Ph.D. and he is now employed under H-1B at a Leukemia Research Center. In his NIW petition
      letter he writes that he is contributing to research at his lab that is directed at finding the origins of the disease, and from
      there he hopes to one day find effective treatments for this type of cancer. Just two weeks ago, he has published two journal
      articles about Leukemia as first author, and he argues that the prospective benefits of his research could one day help find a
      cure. Will Dr. Sam receive an approval for his NIW application from USCIS?<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Case Analysis: </i></b> Probably not! The reason why Dr. Sam’s NIW will likely fail is because he failed to address the concerns of the “outweigh”
      requirement. There is little doubt that his research is important, but Dr.
      Sam has done nothing to show why his work as a researcher is different than any other similarly qualified
      PhD Leukemia researcher. Many Leukemia researchers around the nation have published as first author, and nearly all research in this field could potentially lead to a cure.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      His petition letter fails to address why the benefits of his work “outweigh” the benefits of the Labor Certification Program.
      Another common pitfall that Dr. Sam has fallen into is that he simply writes
      <i> “my work can be used in a potential cure for Leukemia</i>.” He discusses only the potential benefit of his work and not the actual benefit already conferred on his field of
      research.&nbsp;</font>

      How to Meet the NIW &quot;Outweigh&quot; Requirement</font></b>
</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">For a case like
      Dr. Sam’s, the petitioner would write, “Specifically, my work has isolated a gene vital to the pathogenesis of
      this disease, and this research is the basis for several future drug therapies.” Oversights of this type can have an accumulative
      affect on your overall NIW Petition and can make a difference in its adjudication.</font>
</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">Additionally, the tone and underlying theme of most your recommendation letters should be aimed at attacking the “outweigh”
      argument. The alien applicant should always makes it a point to work closely with the authors of the recommendation letters to
      ensure that the emphasis of the letters is always geared towards satisfying this important element of the NIW application.<br>
      <br>
      As you can see, the nuances of the “outweigh” argument can be quite subtle, yet it is one of the most important aspects of
      an NIW petition. Many NIW petitioners who have received RFE’s or denials contact us asking for help, and time
      again it is the failure to address the outweigh theory that has led to their undesirable result.</font>
</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">There are few more pointers to keep in mind when considering this section of the petition letter. The quantity of your published
      articles is not as important as the number of citations to your work from other workers/researchers in your field. A strong NIW
      applicant might have 20 or more citations.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      In the case above, even though Dr. Sam had a couple of published articles as first author, because they are so new, there will be
      very few citations to his work. If you do not have many citations, there are several methods to overcome this weakness that will
      be discussed in a citation article in this package.<br>
