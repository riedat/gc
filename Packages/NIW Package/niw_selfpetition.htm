    <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">1. The Self-petitioning for National
Interest Waiver</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The self-petitioning for EB2-National Interest
Waiver (NIW) is an important part of U.S. Green Card application. The
self-petitioning for National Interest
Waiver does not necessarily refer to filing an application without
any help from your employer, but it refers to filing a Form I-140 petition in the
    National Interest
Waiver category by yourself as both the petitioner and the beneficiary.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">  Most self-petitioners need help from their
employers to prepare the required documents, and many employers
provide such support in document collection for self-petitioners. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
    Services (USCIS) Form I-140
is used for employment based Green Card applications and for National Interest
Waiver petition. The National Interest
Waiver petition can be filed without a job offer, which still falls under the employment based
immigration application.<br>
<br>
If you are considering applying for a Green Card in the NIW category, you should
know the advantages of self-petitioning
for National Interest
Waiver and the disadvantages of employer-based petitioning.</font></p>
    <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. The Advantages of Self-petitioning
for U.S. Green Card in the Category of National Interest Waiver</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Many aliens who have advanced degrees have
    applied for Green Cards through the National Interest Waiver. The advantages are
    obvious: you do not need to have a permanent job offer, you do not need to apply for a
    Labor Certification, and you do not need to be tied to a specific employer. In fact, whether you are a postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student, or a research assistant, if you
    are working on a project funded by NIH, NSF, NASA, DOD, DOE, DOT, etc, you
    may have a good chance to get Green Card through the National Interest
    Waiver, and you can save thousands of dollars compared with hiring a lawyer.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
The major advantages of self-petitioning for National Interest Waiver&nbsp; include:</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">1) You choose your immigration category:
</font> </b><font size="2">You are the person to choose your U.S.
    immigration category, not your employer or a lawyer. By choosing the
    EB2-National Interest Waiver category, you can save time by bypassing the long-time process of
    Labor Certification. Since the National Interest Waiver application cuts down
the requirement to obtain Labor Certification from the U.S. Department of Labor, the path to
receive a Green Card is shorter, and you do not have to have a job offer of a
permanent position from a
    U.S. employer. In many cases, the U.S. Department of Labor has turned down a Labor
Certification application because the alien failed to convince the Department as
to why the employer was not able to hire someone from
the local candidate pool, when many U.S. citizens are available in the labor market.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">2) You have flexibility to change job: </font> </b><font size="2">The application in the
National Interest
Waiver category gives you flexibility and the option to move between different U.S.
employers. You have the freedom to change
    employers. You do not need to stay with your current employer during the entire
Green Card application process, and this advantage gives you a leverage which most immigrants
do not have. For immigration petitions based on Labor
Certification, an alien has to stay with the petitioning employer for the entire
Green Card application process, in some cases, which means working for an
employer without a pay-raise, or even having to take pay-cuts because the alien
applicant does not have any other choice.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">3) Your immigration petition case is always
valid:</font></b> <font size="2"> Because a NIW petition does not depend on your
    current employer, if you change jobs or get laid off, you will not lose your chance
    of obtaining a Green Card, and your petition case is still valid. Since you
do not have to work for the same employer, it is safer for you to survive the
possible company layoff or economic downturn. Even if you change employers or are laid off
and cannot find work temporarily, it does not affect your self-petitioned National Interest Waiver
application.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">4) The immigrant visa number availability:</font></b>
<font size="2">
After the Form I-140 approval, an alien needs an immigrant visa number to file a
Form I-485 application. The Visa Bulletin is generally published around the middle of the preceding month. The Visa Bulletin reflects available visa numbers for cases with priority dates before the listed dates.
The NIW belongs to the second preference EB2 employment-based immigration, and
the
immigrant visa number waiting time is much shorter, sometimes several years
shorter, than the EB3 based immigration application. Often, the immigration visa
numbers in the EB3 category are not available or not &quot;current&quot;, after
aliens obtain their Labor Certification.</font></font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
The other advantages of the self-petitioning for National Interest Waiver include:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You have the ability to avoid dependence on an employer
    or a lawyer;&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You control your Green Card application case
    and process, and it is not controlled by your employer or a lawyer;</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You do not have to have a job offer from a
    U.S. employer for the NIW application;</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You save a lot of money as compared to hiring a
    lawyer.</font></li>
</ul>
    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#006666">3. The Disadvantages of
Employer-based Petition&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The employers who file Green Card
    applications for the alien employees often provide support for document collection.  However, the employers
often pick the easy pass for them, and go through the lengthy Labor
Certification process. Thus, it slows down the entire Green Card application process, and sometimes it
becomes impossible to obtain a Green Card for years, due to the the alien's visa time
restriction or the unavailability of an immigration visa number.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Another disadvantage of employer-based petition is that many employers will use their own attorney.
Most of these company hired attorneys are good at business law, but not at immigration
law. Therefore, the company hired attorneys may concentrate on temporary visas, such as
H-1B visa in most cases, or a simpler Labor Certification process. Since the
    National Interest
Waiver petition is unfamiliar and complex to them, they simply do not want to
spend too much time on the process. In other words, most of the company hired attorneys
are general practice lawyers, not attorneys specialized in complicated Green
Card applications like the National Interest
Waiver.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">4. The
    Disadvantages of Hiring a Lawyer by Yourself</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In fact, there are not many people have good
    experiences with attorneys during their applications of Green Cards. If you
    are going to apply for Green Card based on the National
    Interest Waiver by hiring a lawyer, you need to spend at least $4,000 (the
    normal range is about $4000 to $8000) for the attorney fee, which does not
    even include the application fees to USCIS. During the application process,
    most likely you will completely lost the control as to how fast you would
    like the process to go, once the contract has been signed and the payment
    has been made to the lawyer.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After you signed the contract, your attorney
    normally may tell where to find related information, email you forms for
    Green Card application, give you 2-3 sample letters of recommendation to
    follow, and may also give you a to-do list. After months of you hard work,
    finally the attorney will construct a Form I-140 petition cover letter for
    you, based on all the documents and reference letters that you provided. You
    need to remember that an attorney may has hundreds of cases to deal with at
    the same time. So, he or she has to be fair to every client, and could not
    spend too much time on your case at the expenses of others.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Although an attorney may promise that your
    process would depend on how well you prepare the documents, but he or she
    may keep to convince you that your case is not strong enough, even though
    you may have more than ten articles published in academic journals and two
    patents pending. In fact, there is nothing you really could do, since the
    contract may say very clearly <i>“No guarantee has been made as to the
    time this case will take, neither to the successful outcome of this case.”</i></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Therefore, if you know that you have to go
    through the process all by yourself, you may better do it on your own at the
    first place. On the other hand, you should not blame the lawyers for what
    they are doing, because they can not possibly know all the technical details
    which are of U.S. National Interest in your specific research and some
    specific evidence which could be critical to your case.</font></p>
