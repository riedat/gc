    NIW Approval Story and His Submitted Reference Letters</font></b>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">An alien applicant conducted leading work in the field of
    Chemistry. His research focused on biosynthetic studies of potential anticancer compounds.
    The cancer research generally can be shown to be in the
    U.S. National Interest, as the development of new cancer treatments is a high research priority in the United States.&nbsp;</font>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">
    The alien applicant conducted important research on free radicals, which are potentially harmful atoms or molecules within the body.
    Free radicals reacting with body chemicals can cause disease, including cancer and immune-deficiency diseases.
    The submitted reference letters argued that the alien applicant’s research is of substantial benefit to the health of U.S. citizens and to the U.S. economy, as evidenced by research funding through the National Institutes of Health
    (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).&nbsp;</font>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For the documentary evidence
    submitted with the NIW filing, the alien applicant submitted reference letters from U.S. and international universities and private institutions. These expert
    reference letters
    stated that alien applicant is considered an international leader in the field, who has made substantial contributions to the field of cancer research.
    Twelve publications were authored by this individual, including articles in leading journals and invited book chapters.
    The alien applicant presented research at prestigious conferences, including the highly-selected
    national and international conferences.</font>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Through the reference letters
    and petition cover letter, the alien applicant was able to show that other researchers are building upon
    the applicant's important and essential research findings, as demonstrated by more than seventy
    (70) favorable citations to the work that has been done. This
    applicant is also a member of several professional organizations related to the field, including Phi Lambda Upsilon and the American Chemical Society.&nbsp;</font>

    <p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2.
The General
Guidance for Reference Letters</font></b>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Many immigration experts
believe that reference letters
are necessary for a NIW application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> I</span>f an application is simply a listing of evidence <o:p>where reference letters are
the main sources of discussion of the applicant's work, then the reference letters must
be of high <o:p>quality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, if the application contains background information on the
applicant's work, its actual and <o:p>potential benefits, the
national or international importance, etc., then the USCIS examiners may see
what criteria can be <o:p>met without many reference letters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The key is to determine each
type of evidence and demonstrate how it satisfies the requirements of the NIW criteria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This is what
reference letters are meant to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The reference
letters should be used properly, as a piece
of supporting evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">An alien applicant should have four to five reference letters from senior experts in the field attesting to his/her significant contributions to the field. It is recommended that a variety of reference letters come from people outside the current employer,
and from senior experts in U.S. government and industry.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The basic contents of a reference letter should include:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Writer's qualifications to issue his/her
  opinion, and the position of the writer in the field (or include a copy of the writer's CV);&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  2) How the writer knows the alien's
  work;<br>
  <br>
  3) Alien's background and achievements, as well as commentaries on how the alien's achievements are contributions of major
  significance, and how the alien's
  work has made significant or outstanding contributions to the field;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  4) References to the alien's exceptional ability, such as evidence of presentations at national or international conferences, publications in national or international
  journals, memberships in selective associations or societies; receipts of prizes or awards;<br>
  <br>
  5) Alien possesses unique knowledge, abilities, or experience that sets him/her apart from the professional
  peers, and references or descriptions as to how
  the alien
  may benefit the U.S. in the future.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">It is usually recommended that
the reference letters should come from the following individuals:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Letters from experts in a field, in U.S. or outside U.S.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) At least one letter from a representative of the alien's present employer who is both highly credentialed and knowledgeable of the alien's work.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">3) Letters from experts
who were the alien's academic advisor, or who collaborated with the alien on the research leading to a final product, thesis, or
paper.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">4) Letters from past employers who
are highly credentialed and knowledgeable of the alien's work.</font></p>
</blockquote>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3. What
      Should be Included in a R</font></b><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">eference
      Letter</font></b></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Strong reference letters are key to a successful NIW
      petition. Applicants should realize the significant role that reference letters play in the success of an NIW
      petition. Filing an NIW petition is a significant step and should not be taken lightly.
      Due to the prolonged processing time, reckless filing will substantially delay the time you receive a
      Green Card. Moreover, although the law does not preclude the possibility of repeated filing under the same category, if you file anther NIW
      petition after the rejected one without having significant improvement of your credentials, your case will very likely be rejected again.</font></p>

      <blockquote>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><i><font size="2">1) Qualifications of the Recommender:</font></i></b><font size="2">
      A reference letter needs to include the description of the drafter. An introduction of the employer should be made if a job has been offered. If the drafter comments on the foreign person's achievements or research, a statement should be included in the support letter that establishes the qualifications of these individuals to judge the applicant's work.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Helpful testimonials from
      experts should set apart the applicant from other persons in the field. Expert testimonials of your accomplishments are crucial to your petition. However, keep in mind that expert testimonials should bolster the argument that you meet the standard set by law, i.e., that
      you possess exceptional ability as a researcher and qualify for national interest waiver. Evidence that merely establishes your competence or which fails to set you apart from other persons in the field does not support your case because it carries little weight and may actually be used to deny the petition.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><i><font size="2">2) Substantive Information:</font></i></b><font size="2">
      A good reference letter should point out the high level of unique expertise the applicant possesses. If it is a
      reference letter from an employer or professor of the applicant, it should specify the work the foreign national is responsible for and the requirements of the job. Although a job offer is not required for priority workers, a
      reference letter from an employer can cite to such a position to establish that very few individuals can fill the offered position (i.e., only top individuals in the field or those with exceptional ability can perform the duties required for the position) and the alien is one of these few individuals. In addition,
      reference letters that briefly discuss the petitioner's activities and described him or her as a knowledgeable individual, but lack specific information regarding how the petitioner's contributions had significantly and consistently influenced the field are insufficient.<br>
      <br>
      For example, in establishing a foreign national's exceptional ability for
      NIW purposes, the recommender must pay close attention to the criteria specified in the regulations; the recommender may cite to the types of evidence listed in the regulations. The mere cite to public policy is not a substitute for documentation of
      exceptional ability. In addition, the
      USCIS has made it clear that merely submitting types of documentation from the categories listed in the regulations is insufficient; the evidence must ultimately establish that the beneficiary is a
      foreign national possessing exceptional ability as a researcher and qualify for national interest waiver. Considering the importance of
      reference letters, it is worth the time and efforts for an applicant to seek perfect recommenders and discuss the content of the
      reference letter with them to boost your chance of approval.</font></font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">4.
      Detailed Guidelines on the General Format that Most Reference Letters
      Should Take</font></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Quality reference letters are a critical element of a successful NIW application. While there is no required number of letters
for an NIW petition, in our experience, 6-8 letters is a good rule of thumb for most applications.
Much more important than the quantity of the letters is the quality of the letters themselves. It is better to have
4 high quality letters from established authorities in the field who do not have a relationship with you, than to have
20 mediocre letters from your colleagues at work. Below are detailed guidelines on the general format most letters should take.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><font size="2" face="Arial">First Section: </font></i></b><font size="2" face="Arial"> This first section should discuss how the author knows the
petitioner and his or her work. If the author does not personally know the
petitioner, then be sure to mention that in this section – letters from independent authors carry more weight
with USCIS, and you want to be sure to establish this at the beginning of the letter.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Second Section:</i></b> In this section, the author should discuss where he or she works, work experience, and other credentials. Basically,
the author must convince the Adjudicating Officer that he or she is qualified to review the impact of
petitioner’s work on the National Interest. The author will want to list any positions or titles, as well as his or her educational background.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Third Section: </i></b> This section should be the longest and it is the most important. Here, the author will discuss what he or she knows of
petitioner’s work and explain the national significance of petitioner’s work.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) It is especially important that the author thoroughly discuss how
petitioner has already significantly impacted your field.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>- Key Words and Phrases Example:
</i> “Dr. Kim’s research has already significantly impacted our field through his discovery of…”<br>
<br>
	2) Also discuss why petitioner’s research/work is groundbreaking and of such importance to the field.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>- Key Words and Phrases Example: </i> “Dr. Kasina’s seminal study into the causes of this disease was groundbreaking and pointed research
into this disease into an entirely new direction by…”<br>
<br>
	3) The author can also discuss in detail how the petitioner’s work has significantly advanced important goals in your field.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>- Key Words and Phrases Example: </i> “For a long time our field has searched in vain for the pathogenesis of this disease. Dr.
Jarrett’s study has finally done it….”<br>
<br>
	4) The author may also point out why the petitioner is better than a similarly qualified U.S. worker.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>- Key Words and Phrases Example:</i> “While there are literally thousands of post-doc researchers in this country, finding one with the
skills and achievements of Dr. Serna would be exceedingly difficult.”<br>
<br>
	5) Additionally, the author should discuss the “national impact” of the Applicant’s work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>- Key Words and Phrases Example: </i> “The treatment pioneered by Dr.
Jia will have a direct national impact on those patients afflicted with cancer…”</font></p>
        </blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Fourth Section:</font></i></b><font size="2" face="Arial"> In the conclusion section, the author should write why he or she believes
the petitioner’s continued presence in this country will benefit the field and the national interest.
i.e. “It would be in the best interest of the United States if Dr. Genius were allowed to stay in the country because…”<br>
<br>
<b><i>Overall Length: </i></b> There is no rule of thumb on the length of the letter. If you follow the above guidelines your letter will probably
end up 1 ½ to three pages in length.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">5. Some Key
Factors to Consider When Procuring Your Reference Letters</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Below is a detailed analysis explaining some key factors to consider when procuring your
      reference letters:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) It is worth reiterating that letters from people you do not have a personal or professional relationship with will carry more
weight with the USCIS than those from people who know you. That is not to say that letters from people that know, such as your
colleagues or your boss, are not important, these should definitely be included as
well. But you should try to include at least 2-3 letters from independent experts (those who do not have a personal or professional relationship with you).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Usually, if the author of the letter is in a high position in the organization, the letter will carry more weight. For example, a
letter from the “Director of Research at Laboratory X” will carry more weight than a letter from a “Research Associate at Laboratory
X”.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">3) Letters from nationally recognized agencies such as
<i> The National Science Foundation, American Cancer Society, U.S. Department of
Energy</i>, etc. are extremely persuasive.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">4) Letters from private research laboratories (that you are not employed at) or research institutions such as
<i>Amgen</i>, or <i>U.C. Berkeley</i> are also very persuasive. Again, try to get letters from those higher up such as directors or lead researchers.<br>
<br>
5) Also, make sure that the general language and tone for each of the letters differs from one another. USCIS may get suspicious if
all of the letters are in the same voice or from the same template. Be sure to change some of the structure and language if your
authors are all going off the same template.<br>
<br>
6) And of course, don’t forget to thank the authors of your letters!</font></p>
      </blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">A
strong reference
letter should also include:</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) The reference letters should come from independent experts
in government agencies, premier universities, as well as those from nationally or internationally
renowned persons, verifying that the applicant was one of the leading
experts in the field.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) The reference letters should state that the applicant's extensive credentials and abilities could not be replicated by training others in the
field. The testimonies from experts/scholars should describe how the applicant has contributed to
U.S. National Interest.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">3) The reference letters should provide arguments that the applicant's work benefits the health of U.S. citizens, the U.S. environment, economy, or national security.
As an example of benefiting the health of U.S. citizens, the applicant's work may result in advancements of significant benefit to research on viral infections, diabetes, tuberculosis, pneumonia, or antibiotic resistance, and so
on.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">4) The reference letters may mention that the applicant is a member of
professional societies that are integral to the field.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">5) The reference letters may mention that the applicant intends to
continue to work in the area of his or her exceptional ability which will substantially benefit the interests of the United States in some
degree.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">6) The important issue to keep in mind when applying for the
NIW category is
the uniqueness. The reference letters should show that the applicant is not
a normal, average individual in the field,&nbsp; and the applicant stands out among the crowd in knowledge, skills, and talent.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">7) What form should the reference
letters take?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The most important rule is that there is no proper
format for reference letters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In fact, if
a person gets more than
one reference letter, they should be of varying formats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
