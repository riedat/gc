    <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">RE: Form I-140 Petition of EB2
    National Interest Waiver for Dr. Matthew Mehta </font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Sir or Madam:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is my great pleasure to write this letter in support of Dr.
Matthew Mehta's petition for immigration to the United States. I strongly support
    the&nbsp; EB2 National Interest Waiver application for Dr.
Matthew Mehta. Dr. Mehta is an outstanding young researcher who is making significant contributions to our early lung cancer
    diagnosis research.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Mehta received a Ph.D. degrees from
    University of Chicago in Biomedical Science. He is a highly intelligent, dedicated, and extraordinarily competent young scientist.
    Dr. Mehta
currently holds a position of Research Associate in the Radiology Imaging
    Science (RIS) Center of the Radiology Department of Georgetown
University, and has been working under my direction as part of a research team on
a major early lung cancer detection project. His work has focused on developing a
clinically practical Computer Aided Cancer Diagnosis (CACD) system to help
radiologists in the detection and diagnosis of lung cancer during its early and
curable stage. I worked with Dr. Mehta during his pre-doctoral research,
served on his thesis review committee and I am now one of his supervisors. The
work he is doing is of very high quality and is important for improving the
quality of health care in America.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Mehta has played a major role in the design, execution, and analysis of novel and complex studies of early lung cancer detection
    and has already made significant contributions to the field. Dr. Wang is the author of several full-length publications in prestigious journals,
    manuscripts submitted for publication, and in preparation dealing with the most exciting new development of a lung cancer detection.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lung cancer has become the most common and fatal
malignancy in the United States. It killed an estimated 197,400 Americans in
2006. During
the past ten years, the total number of annual lung cancer cases has climbed
steadily. The 1996 figure was 155,000. In 2006, approximately 197,400 new cases
were diagnosed. It has increased more than any other major malignancy. Since
1997, more women have died of lung cancer than breast cancer, which for over 40
years was the major cause of cancer death in women. Because symptoms of lung
cancer often do not appear until the disease is in advanced steps, early
detection is difficult, yet very crucial to the cure of this deadly disease.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The early detection and diagnosis of lung nodules
in chest radiographs are among the most challenging clinical tasks performed by
radiologists. Previous studies showed that radiologists fail to diagnose small
lung nodules in as many as 30% of positive cases. In a 5-year screening project
at Johns Hopkins Hospital for early detection of lung nodules, it has shown that
the miss rate can be decreased to less than 20% if two or more radiologists work
together. Thus, the development of a computer-aided diagnosis (CACD) system is
able to function as an &quot;alerting system&quot; that points out the potential
lung cancer locations, and as a &quot;second opinion&quot; provider that reports
the possibility of being a lung cancer for each potential cancer location.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Utilizing both digital image processing
techniques and artificial neural networks (ANN), the CACD system successively
perform two functions: (1) location of suspected nodule areas, also known as a
&quot;pre-scan process&quot;, on the digitized chest radiograph, and (2)
differentiation of &quot;true&quot; nodules from &quot;false&quot; nodules,
i.e., lung and chest structures. Our previous studies have shown that the CACD
system has achieved an accuracy that can assist radiologists in detecting early
lung nodules. Dr. Mehta's work represents a significant advance on previous work in
this field.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Mehta's project is a most important proof
of concept of the application of neural networks to early lung cancer detection
on chest radiographs. The Johns Hopkins' Early Lung Cancer Detection Project
consisted of approximately 10,000 prospectively enrolled high risk patients who
were to be screened for the development of lung cancer with sputum cytology and
PA and lateral chest radiographs for 5 years, and were then to be followed
clinically for 14 years to assess long term outcomes. Steve Sweeney, M.D. and
Dominic Travis, M.D. were respectively the Radiologist and Epidemiologist
who directed the program. They have both agreed to serve as consultants to Dr. Mehta's
project.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I was a participating radiologist in the Hopkins'
project, and I realized that the Hopkins' collection of chest
radiographs would be of great value in testing Dr. Mehta's algorithm. Each of the chest
radiographs in the Hopkins' project was obtained with the best available
technology with careful attention to quality. Each was interpreted prospectively
by two radiologists with any disagreements settled by Dr. Sweeney. In 2005, I
started to inquire about the accessibility of the chest radiographs from that
project, and in 2006, I was given possession of all of the approximately 100,000
films.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In order to determine whether the films were
still of adequate quality for the project, I reviewed a sample of the films. We
then digitized 15 cancer cases and processed them with Dr. Mehta's algorithm.
In the original Hopkins' study, one radiologist detected an average of 55% of
those cancers that could be seen retrospectively. In Dr. Mehta's evaluation,
his program detected 68%.&nbsp;The long term survival from lung cancer is
related to the size of the cancer at the time of detection. Dr. Mehta's
results need to be confirmed on a large number of cases, and if confirmed,
should result in a significant improvement in outcome of patients with early
lung cancers.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The major cause of death from cancer is due to cancer spread and growth (metastasis) in organs distant from the primary tumor. Improvements in therapy will only come from a better understanding of the mechanisms
and early detection. The work in my laboratory is sponsored by an RO1 Grant from the U.S. National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health. Dr.
Mehta's development of a new and novel methods for cancer detection holds tremendous promise of better therapy for this devastating disease.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A clinically implemented CACD system can serve
effectively as a second reader of chest radiographs and assist radiologists in
the detection of early lung cancer. The clinical significance of Dr. Mehta's
project and work is that it will help radiologists in their case finding of small
and potentially curable patients with early stage lung cancer. The importance of this research to the national interest means that it should be continued by an
excellent young researcher such as Dr. Mehta.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Dr. Mehta has
shown himself to be a dedicated and effective researcher. I am convinced that it is in the best interest of the United States to grant him permanent residency, thereby assuring continuation of his important research. I therefore support his National Interest Waiver application with great
enthusiasm, and it is definitely in the
U.S. national interest for Dr. Mehta to remain in the U.S. and to continue his research project.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I trust that this letter will serve to strengthen
Dr. Mehta's case and that his petition will be granted. If there are any
questions, please feel free to contact me.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sincerely,</font></p>
