<b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">1. NYSDOT - An Important Case on National Interest
Waiver Petition&nbsp;</font></b>
</p>

    </font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">On August 7, 1998, the USCIS (then INS) issued a precedent decision
raising the
standard for applicants in this category.
Since the passage of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), the USCIS has been
flexible in adjudicating NIW petitions. Each NIW case was decided on its own
merits. There was no clear definition of what &quot;national interest&quot; was.
According to the NYSDOT decision, an
applicant must meet the following three tests:</font>
</p>

<font FACE="Arial">
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Applicant's prospective employment must be in
    an area of &quot;substantial intrinsic merit.&quot;&nbsp; However, the USCIS
  emphasized here that eligibility for the NIW &quot;is not established solely
    by a showing that the beneficiary's field of endeavor has intrinsic
    merit.&quot;</font></p>

    </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) The proposed benefit must be national in
    scope.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">3) Petitioner must show that &quot;the
    national interest would be adversely affected if a labor certification were
    required for the alien.&quot;&nbsp; That is, &quot;the petitioner must
    demonstrate that it would be contrary to the national interest to
    potentially deprive the prospective employer of the services of the alien by
    making available to U.S. workers the position sought by the alien.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <font FACE="Arial">
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Prior to articulating the above, the USCIS had
suggested that the following 7 factors may be influential in determining whether
an applicant's work was in the national interest:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> (1) improving the U.S.
economy;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> (2) improving wages and/or working conditions of U.S. workers;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> (3)
improving education and training programs for U.S. children and/or
under-qualified workers;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> (4) improving health care in the U.S.;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> (5) creating
more affordable housing for low income residents of the U.S.;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> (6) improving the
environment and/or conserving natural resources; or&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> (7) working on behalf of a
U.S. government agency</font></p>

    <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">2. Background Issues and Summary
Questions in Evaluating Whether One Qualifies for NIW</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">NIW has been very popular since its existence. It
has been an option for those who qualify and do not wish to undergo the tedious
and time-consuming process of Labor Certification. Perhaps it is because of the
sheer volume of applications that were filed, the USCIS (then INS) decided to tighten up the
liberals standards that were previously in place.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This case involves the New York State Department
of Transportation (NYSDOT) having employed a foreign national as a Civil
Engineer in 1993. The foreign individual has a Master of Science degree in Civil
Engineering from Iowa State University. His expertise, as articulated by the
lawyer for NYSDOT, is in &quot;pre-stressed concrete construction and design of
post-tensioning and curved bridges.&quot; NYSDOT submitted an employment-based
immigrant visa petition under the National Interest Waiver provision that was
denied by the Vermont Service Center (VSC) in April 1998. This case was
subsequently appealed. NYSDOT was unsuccessful in its appeal and the case was
dismissed by the Administrative Appeals Unit of USCIS. This decision has a significant impact on future NIW filings.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The main issue in this case appears to be whether
it would be in the &quot;national interest&quot; to exempt a foreign national
from having a job offer and requiring the employer to undergo Labor
Certification. The Administrative Appeals Unit in the NYSDOT case repeatedly emphasized on the Labor
Certification itself being in the &quot;national interest.&quot; Thus, &quot;an
alien seeking an exemption from the Labor Certification must present a national
benefit so great as to outweigh the national interest inherent in the Labor
Certification process.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

    </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The decision further stated that it is
insufficient for the employer or the foreign national to show that there are no
available U.S. workers to fill the position that has been offered. After all, it
is the very function of the Labor Certification process. i.e. to test the labor
market. The summary questions in evaluating whether one qualifies for NIW
include:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) <u>Is the alien's offered employment in the
    area of &quot;substantial intrinsic merit?&quot; i.e. are you going to work
    in a field of endeavor that has &quot;intrinsic merit?&quot;</u> In the NYSDOT case, the
USCIS concluded that
earthquake engineering of bridges satisfies the test of &quot;substantial
intrinsic merits.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) <u>Is the proposed benefit national in scope?</u>:
This is where the contradiction comes in. The
Administrative Appeals Unit stated that the New York bridges and roads provided for interstate commerce, and
therefore, serves the national interests of other areas in the country. However,
the Administrative Appeals Unit indicated that the impact of professionals such as attorneys, school
teachers or chefs are &quot;so attenuated at the national level as to be
negligible.&quot; This contradicts earlier opinion that were issued by the
Administrative Appeals Unit which opined that small national interest is sufficient even if it indirectly benefited
through regional or local action.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">3) <u>Will the national interest be adversely
    affect if a Labor Certification were required for the alien?</u>: This last evaluating standard concentrates on the
alien. The Administrative Appeals Unit in the NYDOT case stated that the very purpose of the Labor
Certification was to protect U.S. workers from being displaced by foreign
workers. Therefore, one must convince the USCIS that national benefit of a Labor
Certification exemption was &quot;so great as to outweigh the national interest inherent in
the labor certification process.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#006666" face="Arial" size="2">3. The Analysis of Three Prongs of the NYSDOT
Tests for a NIW Petition</font></b></p>
  <font FACE="Arial">
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Under the first prong of the NYSDOT test, the alien must seek employment in an area that has substantial intrinsic merit. In NYSDOT, the alien was a structural engineer working on highway bridges. This activity was found to have substantial intrinsic merit. It is obvious that the protection of motorists and the maintenance of a highway system are activities of substantial intrinsic merit. By contrast, a person who is a juggler and asserts that he or she wishes to perform at children's birthday parties, might not meet this requirement. While the alien's proposed activity is not deleterious, it would be difficult to claim that such an activity has "substantial" intrinsic merit for purposes of establishing the "national" interest.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The second prong of the NYSDOT test requires that the waiver applicant demonstrate that the proposed benefit to be provided will be national in scope. There are many activities which have positive effects, such as job creation for a local community, but may in fact have a limited, or even
negative, national impact. For example, an alien may be sought as a loan officer for a regional bank. The alien’s clients may come from various parts of the country, but the primary purpose of the alien’s employment is to benefit the regional bank, not to benefit the nation as a whole.&nbsp;The principal aim of the alien’s activities is to benefit the bank, not the nation.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> As another example, an alien may be sought to manage a waste disposal facility for a municipal government. That facility, however, may be contributing to pollution of a nearby river. While the alien’s activities might result in the preservation of local jobs, his or her activities might in fact have a detrimental effect on other communities lying along the path of the stream or river, even those located in other states. Therefore, any interest in hiring this person would be local at best, and could not be deemed to be national in scope or in the “national” interest.<br>
<br>
On a related note, the basis for the waiver may not be the existence of a local labor shortage. The mere fact that the alien might fill a locally needed position - irrespective of the positive effect of such activity - does not qualify the activity as being in the national interest. While there exists a generalized national interest in providing jobs to all work authorized persons, the national interest waiver is a waiver of the labor certification requirement - it is not a substitute for this requirement. Congress specifically created the labor certification process in order to test the domestic local labor market.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> A shortage of qualified workers in a given field does not constitute grounds for a national interest waiver. Given that the labor certification process was designed to address the issue of worker shortages, a shortage of qualified workers is an argument for obtaining rather than waiving a labor certification.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, under the third prong of the NYSDOT test, it must be demonstrated that the national interest would be adversely affected if the employer is required to proceed with the labor certification process. In order to satisfy the third component of the test, therefore, it must be shown "that it would be contrary to the national interest to potentially deprive the prospective employer of the services of the alien by making the position sought available to U.S. workers."&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> In addition, NYSDOT further requires, as a condition of meeting the third prong,
<i> "that the alien will serve the national interest to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications."</i> This test recognizes that there can be two competing "national interests" - the national interest, as set forth by Congress in section 212(a)(5) of the INA, of requiring a test of the labor market versus the "national interest" in fulfilling a permanent need for the alien's services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Given the variety of occupations potentially covered by the waiver, a single set of standards applicable to all cases is impractical. Therefore each determination must be made on a case-by-case basis and will depend on an assessment of the specific facts presented.<br>
<br>
To meet the third prong, the petitioner might be able to demonstrate that the need for the alien’s services is so great that the national interest would not be properly served were the petitioner required to postpone employment of the alien until the labor certification process is completed. An example would be the need for an alien epidemiologist to work on prevention of an epidemic following a natural disaster. Obviously, time would be of the utmost essence in such a case.</font></p>

<p><b><font color="#006666" face="Arial" size="2">4. An Alien Applicant Must
Have Demonstrable Achievements</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It should be remembered that while the NYSDOT decision sets forth these three minimum criteria which must be met in order to establish eligibility for a national interest waiver, the presence of these factors, alone do not necessarily mean that
USCIS will grant the NIW approval. In addition to the above, an alien applicant should also bear in mind the following general considerations with respect to adjudicating requests for national interest waivers:</font></p>

  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">An alien seeking immigrant classification as an alien of exceptional ability or as a member of the professions holding an advanced degree cannot meet the threshold for a national interest waiver of the job offer requirement simply by establishing a certain level of training or education which could be articulated on an application for a
      Labor Certification.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">General arguments regarding the importance of a given field of endeavor, or the urgency of an issue facing the U.S., cannot by themselves establish that an individual alien benefits the national interest, by virtue of engaging in the field, or seeking an as yet undiscovered solution to the problematic issue.</font></li>
  </ul>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In all cases, while the national interest waiver hinges on prospective national benefit, it clearly must be established that the alien’s past record justifies projections of future benefit to the national interest. The petitioner’s subjective assurance that the alien will, in the future, serve the national interest cannot suffice to establish prospective national benefit if the alien has few or no demonstrable achievements.</font></p>
