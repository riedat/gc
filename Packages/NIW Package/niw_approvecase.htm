The Alien Applicant's Work is very Important to People's Health in the United
States &nbsp;</font>
</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#000000">A
nutrition researcher
with expertise in the development of low-fat foods, obtained an EB2 National
Interest Waiver approval, based on his work at a Fortune 500 food and beverage company and a track record of achievement. While it is
not immediately obvious that developing low-fat coffee beverages is in the national interest of the United States,
the alien applicant developed a series of arguments that persuaded the USCIS
Service Center to grant the NIW approval.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
researcher of the low-fat coffee beverage held two degrees: a Master degree in food science and a
bachelor degree in chemical engineering. The national interest waiver petitioner
argued that his work in developing low-fat foods is very important to the health of the nation and important to the provision of a variety of
food choices.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">Under this argument,
the alien applicant presented information from the National Institutes of Health showing that obesity has been shown to either increase the risk for, or exacerbate such conditions as, hypertension, lipid disorders, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, sleep apnea, respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, and certain types of cancers.
He also showed that these and other obesity-related diseases cost nearly $100 billion per
year in United States. The alien applicant also showed that the government recently released new “Federal Obesity Clinical Guidelines,” endorsed by major medical associations throughout the United States, to treat obesity.<br>
<br>
In addition to the federal interest in low-fat foods, the alien applicant also showed that the U.S. consumer is interested in the further development of low-fat food choices.
He presented a reference letter from the Calorie Control Council, an international association that represents the low-calorie and reduced-fat food and beverage industry. The letter attested to the national significance of lower fat foods. Furthermore, the letters of recommendation, including one from the president of a leading U.S. contract R&amp;D organization that develops food products, attested to the fact that consumers’ demand for reduced and low-fat food product development is strong.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><b><font color="#006666" face="Arial" size="2">2.
The Nutrition Researcher's Work Will also Benefit the Economy of United States</font>
</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the market for low-fat foods is growing, and his
research has caused the emergence of a new market segment for cold-coffee beverages.
The alien applicant also showed how new low-fat food products, derived from innovations in health and food-processing technologies, benefited the national economy. Such low-fat and reduced-fat products represented a significant market in the food industry in the United States. The
nutrition researcher, through his past endeavors at a private research and development lab, and his current work at one of the largest U.S. beverage companies, played a critical role in developing such foods and thereby directly benefited the national economy.<br>
<br>
The applicant included numerous magazine and newspaper articles about one of the products he played a role in developing. These articles showed that the industry was a multi-million dollar per year
industry in United States, and that this new product was credited with opening up an entirely new market share. These articles came from
<i> Supermarket News, The Hartford Courant</i>, and <i> Food Processing Magazine.</i>&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">He
even included a transcript of a Cable News Network (CNN) broadcast where a market analyst commented on the company’s growth potential. One article called the product one of the top ten new products of the year it was introduced. It had over 80% of the market share in its segment, and was responsible for almost $100 million in sales. Quite importantly, the product was hailed in its company’s annual report as part of its growth strategy of investing in “big opportunities,” and this company is a $10 billion company.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
above two arguments, directly relating the development of this product to the nation’s health concerns and the U.S. economy, satisfied the criteria that the foreign national’s work was of
“<i>substantial intrinsic merit</i>” and <i>&quot;national in scope.&quot;</i> Since these products were distributed and marketed nationally, their impact was national. But the final standard, that the beneficiary’s work will impact the national interest to a substantially greater degree than the work of his U.S. citizen colleagues, still had to be surmounted.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#006666">3.
The Nutrition Researcher Will Impact the
Field as a Whole to a Substantially Greater Degree than his U.S. Citizen
Counterparts</font></b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
nutrition researcher will impact the field as a whole to a substantially
greater degree than his U.S. citizen counterparts, thereby outweighing the interests in preserving the
Labor Certification process in this case.<br>
<br>
Here, the alien applicant showed that the beneficiary had a past record that justifies the future projections of benefit to the nation. The
nutrition researcher
in this case had a proven track record of developing successful low-fat products. He had developed
ready-to-drink weight loss products for a leading diet supplement company, a low-fat ice cream for an ice cream maker, and a reduced-fat peanut butter spread for a food-service company. His most recent endeavor was the low-fat coffee drink product that had garnered huge success.<br>
<br>
Also important to establishing the nutrition
researcher’s benefit to the field were letters of recommendation from academics, private research labs, and the Fortune 500 company. All concluded that this
nutrition researcher
had a special talent in developing and processing low-fat and reduced-fat foods. He also had recognizable expertise with numerous fat-replacement systems as well as heat preservation technologies, and shelf-life stability analyses.</font>

Conclusion</font>
</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">The NIW
approval is now difficult to obtain. While USCIS has changed direction in its adjudications, NIWs are still possible for individuals who play critical roles at their companies and have a proven track record of achievement, showing that they are significantly better in their field than their U.S. citizen counterparts.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
NYSDOT
case will stop frivolous NIW cases from being filed. But truly deserving cases, such as engineers working on important technologies and medical professionals doing cutting-edge research,
will still be able to obtain NIW approval<br>
