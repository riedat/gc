of Showing Your Achievement and Benefits to U.S. National Interest in a Petition
Cover Letter</font></font></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">There are certain words
or types of language which are useful for your petition cover letter. USCIS examiners are gradually
getting better at understanding the basic issues in the most common fields, such
as scientific researchers, engineers, and physicians, but they still like to see in the
cover letter that the applicant is 'outstanding', 'at the top of the field', 'on the cutting
edge', 'pioneering', etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  You should </span>remember
that the entire application is about setting yourself apart from the others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Some applicants go into too much detail
in the cover letter about the applicant's personal or social
attributes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> For example, </span>it is good to say that
the applicant is honest, dedicated, and pleasant, but when this drags into
multiple paragraphs, it gets in the way off the cover letter's main purpose. When a person applies for a job,
an employer wants to know if the person
will be a pleasant coworker, so more personal comments are reasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>However, for a NIW application, an USCIS examiner only wants to know how the
applicant compares to others in the field.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"> Therefore, a cover letter should:</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Present testimonials attesting to your exceptional ability;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Provide evidence that you have distinguished yourself from your peers;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">3) You are seeking employment in an area of substantial intrinsic merit;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">4) Prove that the prospective substantial benefits you will offer are national in scope;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">6) Discuss your work and its current and future applications, both academically and in the private industry if
        possible;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">7) Describe your work, how it affects the field of study, its potential for broader
        applications;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">8) Describe how you are essential or intimately connected to the work, the effects of this work on the U.S. and its
        people;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">9) Explain that the delay caused by the Labor Certification process will be detrimental to
        U.S. national interest.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The methods of showing your
achievement or recognized work in the cover letter include:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Go into detail about the journals which published your articles,
    perhaps a thorough discussion of the peer review process with notes about the
types of experts chosen as manuscript reviewers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Talk at length about the actual or potential benefits of your
    work, and show statistics which paint a clear picture of the importance of your
work.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">If applicable, discuss the
economic benefits of your work, or show economic statistics related with your study.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">If applicable, discuss the
    normal people benefits of your work. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">For
    example, for </span>medical researchers, economic statistics can be discussed together
with human suffering from conditions which you study.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Remember that USCIS examiners
are human beings; some information will have a stronger psychological impact than
other information. Here, we need to think about the examiner's psyche, and make the examiners
realize that your work is important and that they can feel good about approving
your case.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. How to Convince the
Immigration Officers that You Have Done Exceptional Work</font></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">You should write the cover letter in general terms as if you were writing for
<i> Time</i> or <i> Newsweek</i> magazine. Immigration officers with bachelor's or higher degrees will read the cover letter and the reference letters. They cannot know your field, but they do spend most working days evaluating and synthesizing information and drawing conclusions.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Therefore, you need to convince the immigration officers that you have done and/or are doing exceptional work, and that your work will help U.S. citizens and someone they know, and you need to explain how your research is
useful. For example:</font></p>

      <blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) "a gene that affects an essential biological function can help diagnose a disease
and treat the fetus or the neonate;&quot; or</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) "identify biological patterns found in epidemic disease models and in population models, and apply the lessons learned to models that characterize the dynamic behavior of computer networks, and develop immunization techniques to safeguard against the spread of computer viruses while strengthening the security and performance of
networks;&quot; or</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">3) "adds carbon nanotube fillers to traditional vibration reduction materials to enhance their energy dissipation capability, and improve their ability to operate at high temperatures. The outcome of the research will benefit the performance, cost, safety, and reliability of future manufacturing equipment, hand-held tools, sensitive laboratory equipment, and everyday electronic
devices;&quot; or</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">4) "develop new techniques for measuring electric current and heat transfer properties across various types of nanojunctions, the research may be applied to the future design and development of nanoelectronics and highly efficient thermoelectric energy conversion
devices;&quot; or<br>
<br>
5) "investigating and solving problems in medicine and biology by molecular engineering of materials and surfaces, and working to design new molecules that may one day fend off an HIV infection."</font></p>

      </blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Also, you may need to provide documentation on how much the problem you are trying to solve costs each year in dollars, resources, or human suffering.
You may also explain how you are essential to the success of the research or
project.&nbsp;</font></p>

    3. How to Draw the USCIS Examiner's Attention and Distinguish Yourself from
    other Applicants</font></b>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Let us discuss a hypothetical example which should illustrate
    a petition cover
    letter's issue. Assume that there is an applicant who is a medical researcher. Among this person's evidence are
    8 publications and funded research. If the petition cover letter is a simple listing of evidence, then this applicant will look like so many others. There is nothing to draw
    the USCIS examiner's attention and distinguish the applicant from the hundreds of other applicants.&nbsp;On the other hand, the applicant
    may look at the journals in which the publications appeared, and explain the following
    question in the cover letter:</font>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">
    Were they international, peer-reviewed journals?</font>

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">
    How many publications per year did the applicant produce?</font>

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">
    Was the applicant the first author? If not, was the second author or last author
    important?</font>

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">
    Who funded the research? Was it a U.S. government agency? This would show national importance.</font>

  </li>
</ul>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The key here is to dissect each type of evidence and demonstrate how it satisfies the substance of the
    NIW criteria. After all, this is what the cover letter is meant to do. If the petition cover letter contains background information about the journals, about the sources of funding, importance of the work, etc., then it is clear that the
    provided evidence may satisfy the NIW criteria.</font>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Also, the cover letter can quote the regulations directly to spell out the
    law. To help ensure that your case will not be wrongfully denied by inexperienced USCIS
    examiners, when writing the cover letter, you can quote the regulations directly to spell out the law for a potentially less-than-informed adjudicator. That way, the examiner should not be confused about language or requirements, and it will lead to accurate adjudications on the first try.<br>
