    The Priority Date and the Advantage of Filing the I-485 at the Earliest
    Opportunity</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">Understandably, many people confuse the concept of Priority Dates.
The Priority Dates determine when an alien applicant will have the ability to file the final stage of the application for
a Green Card, known as the Adjustment of Status or Form I-485 application. The advantage of filing the
Form I-485 at the earliest opportunity is that it allows the alien applicant and any immediate family members the
following opportunities:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">1)
file for the EAD or the Employment Authorization Document - permission to work without having to maintain a temporary worker status such as H1B, and&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">2)
file Advance Parole - permission to reenter the U.S. after travel abroad while the I-485 is pending.&nbsp;</font></p>

employment-based immigration requiring Labor Certification,
a priority date is the officially acknowledged date that the case was filed at the U.S. Department of Labor. If
the employment-based case was filed in a category that does not require Labor
Certification, such as EB1 and EB2 NIW, then the priority date assigned by the USCIS is the date
that the Form I-140 is received by an USCIS Service Center.<br>
<br>
A person determines when he or she will be able to file for the Form I-485 by checking the dates each month on the
<a target="_blank" href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/bulletin/bulletin_1360.html"> <font color="#006666"> Visa Bulletin
Chart</font></a>. Every month, the U.S. Department of State publishes the Visa Bulletin which is posted at U.S. Department of State's website. The Visa Dates indicate whether the dates are current or whether there is a backlog in order to file for the Adjustment of Status or
Form I-485. The priority date must also be considered for consular processing (CP) filings.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#006666">2.
    Understand the Visa Bulletin and the Immigrant Visa Quota<br>
    </font></b><br>
    By law, there is a quota or limit to the number of people who can receive a
    Green Card in a given year. This quota is based both on the employment-based category (EB1, EB2, or EB3, etc.) and on "per country" limits, meaning that every country, no matter how large or how small, is given the same maximum percentage allocation of the worldwide quota. Countries like China and India with large populations are then subject to longer waiting times than a person born in a neighboring country like Pakistan or Nepal.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The number of spaces, sometimes referred to as "visa numbers", for a particular country, that are available at any given time, will depend on various factors, for example, how many immigrant visas have been approved at consulates abroad, how many I-485 applications have been approved for persons from that country in the U.S. during the prior month, etc. Such factors determine the movement of priority dates and, in turn, will affect the number of I-485 applications that can be filed during the following month after the priority dates are released.<br>
    <br>
    If the Visa Bulletin chart states "C" for a given category and country, that indicates that the numbers are current in the specific employment-based category, whether EB1, EB2, or EB3, and that there is no waiting period for filing the I-485 application. If the numbers are backlogged as indicated on the Visa Bulletin, there will be a date mentioned, sometimes called a "cut-off date". If the Priority Date is
    before the date indicated, then an alien applicant is eligible to file the I-485 application for adjustment of status during the particular month when the dates are current.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    It is important to note the month for which the Visa Bulletin chart is issued. The Visa Bulletin is released about 2 weeks in advance. For example, if the Priority Date is not current for April of this year, but when the May dates are issued in mid-April the chart shows that the date will be current for May of this year, then
    an alien applicant will be able to file the I-485 during the month of May. If the I-485 application reaches the USCIS early, say on April 30, when the dates only become current in May, the case will either be rejected by the
    Service Center's mailroom, or if it is processed, the I-485 may be denied one or two years later – merely for filing a day too early!</font></p>

    What Happens If a Priority Date Will Retrogress?</font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">A often asked question is
    what happens that the Priority Date will retrogress for my application? If a person has already filed the I-485 application when the priority
    dates were current, but then the Visa Bulletin date retrogresses to a date before the priority date, the foreign national would still accrue the benefit of being able to remain in the U.S. with renewable EAD
    and permission to travel, even after completing the six years on H1B status in the U.S. However, the
    Form I-485 application could not be approved until the date becomes
    &quot;current&quot; again.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">When the immigration visa number is unavailable for an alien, either because of the total unavailability of the visa numbers for everyone in certain category, or when the visa number is generally available
because of the cutoff date and one's priority date is far from the cutoff date, there are two consequences taking place depending
on at what stage an alien is in for the Green Card process.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">For those who have already submitted I-485 applications, it means that the USCIS will not be able to conclude his/her application during the period of visa unavailability, and the USCIS will just store the application and wait for the visa number availability for him or her, until it becomes available.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">For those who are still at the stage of I-140
        application or Labor Certification, it means that even if
        an alien employee can get the I-140 or Labor Certification approval, the alien
        will not be able to file an I-485 application during such period, and consequently no EAD or Advance Parole will be available as well.&nbsp;</font></li>
