    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">RE: Form I-140 Petition of EB2 National
    Interest Waiver for Dr. Matthew Mehta</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Sir or Madam:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I am writing in enthusiastic support for Dr. Matthew
Mehta's
petition for immigration to the United States. Specifically, I am writing to
provide evidence that Dr. Mehta's work is in the national interest of this
country. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> The
Georgetown University Medical Center is a comprehensive medical research center. As a
professor and chairman of the Radiology Department and Director of the Radiology
Imaging Science (RIS) Center, my work is dedicated to better understand of the cancer spread leading to the design of new approaches to
its early detection. The research in our center includes basic and clinical
research. I have worked in this field for approximately 20 years. Enclosed please find my
Curriculum Vitae documenting my qualifications to recommend Dr. Mehta for his
EB2 National Interest Waiver immigration application.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before coming to
Georgetown University Medical Center, Dr. Mehta did his PhD and Post-doc fellow
    research at the University of Chicago in Biomedical Science. During his PhD
    study, he constructed appropriate viral vectors to carry the IL-2 gene and injected these vectors into tumors growing in
    mice. He discovered that the mechanism involves basic fibroblast growth
    factors and metalloproteinases-2. He also discovered that tumor regression subsequent to introduction of the IL-2 gene into primary neoplasms was
    associated with induction of systemic immunity and, hence, regression of tumors distant from site of therapy.
    His research results were published at famous <i>Cancer Research</i> in
    2008.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">During his Post-doc fellow research, Dr.
    Mehta used the novel gene therapy against human prostate cancers growing in the prostate of athymic nude mice with
    dramatic therapeutic results. Dr. Mehta discovered that the enzyme elastase expressed in neutrophils
    is most important for the induction of angiogenesis. Because neutrophils can infiltrate into tumors, they can accelerate the growth of the tumors.
    The most important discovery made by Dr. Wang involved the design of new and novel vectors to introduce the interleukin-2 gene into tumors. Specifically, he used tumor cells infected with a lentinovirus engineered to carry the interleukin-2
    gene. This discovery is novel, exciting, and far-reaching. The single intratumor injection of this unique interleukin-2
    construct produced not only complete regression of actively growing tumors, but also destruction of distant lung
    metastases. His research results were published at prestigious <i>Journal of
    Biomedical Science</i> in 2010.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Mehta is
currently a research associate in the RIS Center of the Radiology Department of
Georgetown University Medical Center. He has proposed various computer-aided
diagnosis schemes for early detection and classification of cancerous lung
nodules.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite great improvements in diagnosis, surgical techniques, and systemic therapy, the majority of cancer patients still
die of metastases (cancer spread). Lung cancer is one of the most common and deadly
diseases in the world. During the last decade, it has become clear that the progressive growth and spread
of cancer cells to distant organs is dependent on the induction and maintenance of vascular supply. The cure of lung cancer depends highly on the early
detection and treatment of small and localized tumors. However, early detection
of cancerous lung nodules in chest radiographs has been a clinically difficult
and challenging task.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Although skilled and experienced lung
radiologists can achieve a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of chest
nodules, still the performance of using direct inspection is limited by the
subjective decision criteria used by different radiologists, a time consuming
detection cycle, and high miss rate of small and low contrast nodules surrounded
by noisy anatomic lung background. Among the researches of improving the
diagnostic accuracy, Computer Assisted Cancer Diagnosis (CACD) has been
concluded as a promising approach.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A prototype of
computer-aided system has recently been implemented with Dr. Mehta's primary efforts. We
are in the stage of evaluating the system in a clinical setting. This system
will be used to assist the chest radiologist in detecting lung cancer.&nbsp;Recently, we have received an American Cancer
Society Research Award which extremely encourage us to continue working on
advanced intelligent systems to assist radiologists in early detection of lung
and breast cancers. Dr. Mehta's
research is a timely project prior to a commercial implementation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Mehta 's
innovative research, using artificial neural networks to detect lung nodules,
was an idea with a great potential. He has been working on the
development and application of CACD system in digital chest radiography to
enhance the detection of small or potential cancerous nodules. He has unique
expertise in numerous complex techniques including artificial neural networks,
genetic algorithms, and fuzzy logic.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Application of these techniques and understanding
of clinical aspects of lung cancer permit him to develop an intelligent medical
diagnostic imaging system. Furthermore, his research may have broader
implications in other medical or difficult diagnosis tasks, such as early
detection of breast cancer in mammography. Dr. Mehta's exciting development has been processed for a patent application, and the data are submitted for publication. The
development of this technique is clearly in the U.S. national interest.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Mehta has been one of the pioneers in using the neural networks for lung nodule
detection. He wants to dedicate his research career in making the use of the
neural networks in lung cancer detection clinically relevant. Dr. Mehta is
currently conducting an important project of using CACD for detecting lung
cancer based on a large proven cancer database. The database, which is in our
possession, consists of the complete medical records and chest x-ray images of
10,000 lung cancer cases collected over the past 20 years by Johns Hopkins
Medical Center. Dr. Mehta will be using this database to test the system that he has been developing. The success of this project will
potentially increase radiologists' diagnostic accuracy and reduce health care
cost.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I am Dr. Mehta's supervisor and have known him
for four years. Dr. Mehta is intelligence, hard work, and commitment to
lung cancer research. Dr. Mehta is in a unique position to assist radiologists in the
early detection of lung cancer. His research is doubtlessly in the national
interest of the United States. I believe that Dr. Mehta will be very
productive in his research efforts, and I fully support and recommend that his
petition be granted.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sincerely,</font></p>
