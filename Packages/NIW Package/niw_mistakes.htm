    <p><b><font face="Arial" color="#006666" size="2">1. The Most Common
    Mistakes Made by Petitioners</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The three most common mistakes made by
    petitioners are:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(1) excessive supporting documents;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(2) poorly drafted expert reference
      letters;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(3) inadequately argued presentations in
      the cover letter.&nbsp;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most petitioners confuse quantity with
    quality. As a result, they substitute hundreds of pages of supporting
    documents for few well crafted supporting exhibits. USCIS examiners have a
    limited amount of time to review each petition. If they run out of time
    while going through an excessively lengthy petition, they have to take time
    away from other petitions. Rather, they will just stop and make a decision
    based on what they have seen up to that point.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Therefore, expert reference letters must
    establish three things:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">First, they must establish that the person
        writing the letter is a genuine expert.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Second, the letter must clearly explain
        how the letter writer came to know the factual information stated in the
        letter.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Third, the expert must offer an opinion
        that is relevant to the matter being considered.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial" color="#006666" size="2">2. The
    Advocacy Is the Most Important Part of a NIW Petition</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To avoid the above mistakes, the petitioner
    should know that advocacy is the most important part of a NIW petition. In this
    case, advocacy means the way the law and facts are argued in support of the
    petition. A large number of meritorious cases have been rejected because of
    poor advocacy, and a large number of marginal cases have been approved
    because of good advocacy. Since the US Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration
    Services (USCIS) has not created any checklists, the examiner must be
    persuaded that the case has merit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The advocacy is the core of the NIW petition. No matter how well qualified the beneficiary may be, if the case
    is not persuasively argued, it is not going to be approved. A well argued
    case explains the attached exhibits and relates the facts to the specific
    legal requirements articulated in the statute, regulations, legislative
    history, USCIS policy memos, and prior cases. In the end, the argument makes
    it clear that the petitioner has put forward a conclusive case for approval.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If the argument is too long and boring, the
    examiner will lose interest before understanding the merits of the case. If
    the argument is too short and unconvincing, the examiner will not be
    persuaded. A successful case strikes the right balance between sufficient
    detail and argument to establish eligibility, without unnecessary repetition
    or the inclusion of irrelevant facts or arguments. More
than any other types of cases, NIW petitions are won or lost on the strength of
the arguments presented.</font></p>

        <p><b><font color="#006666" face="Arial" size="2">3. It Is not Enough to List
Your Evidence and Expect that the USCIS Examiner Will Approve Your Application</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">  The USCIS has repeatedly stated that the significance of each type of evidence must be evaluated by
examiners, which also means that simply providing minimal evidence is not sufficient for
a NIW petition approval.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">  The USCIS examiners have broad discretion to evaluate the evidence. It is not enough to provide basic documentation to satisfy the regulations.
An examiner will go through the evidence and decide if it is substantial enough to distinguish you in some
way from the rest of your peers.
Probably 99% of cases which are denied by the USCIS are denied on subjective grounds. Basically, it is not enough to list your evidence and expect that the examiner will approve your application.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The USCIS has raised the bar higher than before for obtaining
NIW classification approval. However, the USCIS' decisions remain consistent over the past
years, and stick clearly to the statute and regulations. It does appear that the
National Interest Waiver category may be moving toward a higher standard of review, paralleling similar patterns in EB1-Extraordinary Ability
and
EB1-Outstanding Ability adjudications.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Specifically, there have been RFEs (Request For Evidence) from USCIS regarding the
experience, achievement recognition, and the nature of the position. However, USCIS decisions are firmly grounded in the statute and regulations. Therefore, it is very important for
alien applicants to carefully present
eligibility and strong evidence for the
USCIS Service Center to approve your case.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">You can present direct evidence towards a
      factor or criterion, or you can
      argue that some of your achievement should be considered as an equivalent or comparable evidence towards the criterion.
      But most importantly, you should not be afraid to try, and keep in mind that a denied
      NIW immigration petition will not affect your future other immigration petitions through the same category or
      in different categories.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font color="#006666">4. The NIW
      Adjudication Standards and the Request For Evidence - Do NOT Hold Back
      Some Evidence</font></b><br>
      <br>
      In a meeting between the immigration community and the USCIS, several
      issues regarding NIW adjudication were discussed. Of particular interest
      was an inquiry regarding USCIS explanation of when it will deny a NIW case
      outright, and when it will issue a Request for Evidence (RFE), or Notice
      of Intent to Deny (“NOID”).<br>
      <br>
      The USCIS explained that it may issue an RFE if the required “initial
      evidence” is provided, but the officer has a question about the
      approvability of the case or requires additional information or
      documentation. A NOID may be issued if the officer is leaning toward a
      denial, but a rebuttal to the specific reason for denial would assist in
      enduring an appropriate adjudication. The USCIS may deny an NIW case
      outright, without issuing an RFE or NOID, when a petition is “lacking
      the required initial evidence”. For an EB2 National Interest Waiver
      case, the required initial evidence includes:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) He or she seeks work in an area of substantial intrinsic merit: The alien must play a significant role in an area of substantial intrinsic merit, and must not be simply a minor constituent who took part thereof.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        2) The candidate's proposed work will benefit the nation as a whole: The alien proposed benefit should be national in scope. The alien must be involved in an undertaking activity that will substantially benefit the United States.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        3) The significant benefit derived from the alien's participation in the national interest field should considerably outweigh the national interest in using the Labor Certification process: The National interest would be adversely affected if a Labor Certification were required for the alien. Under a NIW, an alien who seeks an exemption from the job offer requirement must be able to demonstrate that the benefit his or her activity would provide to the nation is so great as to outweigh the nation's interest inherent in completion of the Labor Certification process.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">These broad definitions of the term
      “initial evidence” encompass nearly all the substantive evidence an
      NIW petitioner will present for a case. In practical terms, this means
      that the USCIS could potentially deny a case outright, without an RFE or
      NOID, if they believe that any pertinent evidence for the case is
      “lacking.” How the USCIS defines the term “lacking” is unclear,
      but we have received inquiries from several denied self-petitioners whose
      cases may offer some insight into this definition. These cases that were
      denied without an RFE or NOID. Although their initial evidence was not
      very strong, all of the required initial evidence was submitted, thus
      suggesting the term “lacking” as used by the USCIS means “not good
      enough” as opposed to “missing”.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Based on the inquiry and the USCIS' answer, and our own observations of
      NIW adjudications, it does appear that the USCIS is increasingly issuing
      denials without giving the petitioner a chance to respond to an RFE or
      NOID. Keeping this alarming trend in mind, it bears pointing out that it
      is best to present all available evidence in the initial submission to the
      USCIS.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><u><font size="2" face="Arial">We are aware that many petitioners feel
      that it is wise to hold back some evidence in case an RFE is issued - we
      never agreed with this strategy, and it could lead to an outright denial
      of the case. It is important for petitioners to submit a complete and well
      presented case to the USCIS to avoid the unhappy result of a denial
      without an RFE or NOID.</font></u></p>
