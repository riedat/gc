<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">1. The
Applicant's Employment Should be in an Area of Substantial Intrinsic Merit&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In requesting for a national
interest waiver, the applicant should show that he or she seeks employment in an
area of substantial intrinsic merit. The applicants' employment must be
important to the national interests of the United States, and the benefits of
the applicant's employment should be immediately apparent to the national
interests of the United States.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The evidence provided should
establish that the work done by the applicant is significant and in U.S.
national interest. The applicant’s work or research should posses substantial
intrinsic merit of national benefits, and the evidence should demonstrate his or
her unique and essential contributions.</font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. The
Applicant's Employment Should be National in Scope</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the NIW petition, the applicant
should provide evidence to show that the benefits of the applicant's employment
will be national in scope. The applicant's employment may be limited to a
particular geographic area, but the applicant must establish benefit to more
than a particular region of the country. Moreover, there should be little or no
adverse impact on the interests of other regions of the country.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The applicant’s work should offer
significant national benefits. A petition cannot rely on speculative future
benefits, and a research that <i>may</i> lead to results that benefit the
national interest are not sufficient to warrant a grant of a NIW.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For the submitted reference letters,
it is not enough to only stress the general importance of the applicant’s work
or research. The national importance of one’s field of study does not
establish the importance of one’s work in particular.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#006666" size="2">3. The Applicant
Should Demonstrate that the National Interest Would be Adversely Affected if a
Labor Certification Were Required for the Alien</font></b><font size="2"><br>
<br>
One NIW petition threshold in the NYSDOT case's <b><i>Three-Prong Test </i></b>is
that it must be persuasively demonstrated that the national interest would be
adversely affected if a labor certification were required for the alien. The
applicant should demonstrate that it would be contrary to the national interest
to potentially deprive the prospective employer of the services of the
petitioner, by making available U.S. workers to the position sought by the
applicant.<br>
<br>
In the petition, the applicant should submit evidence to persuasively establish
that the national interest would be adversely affected if employer were required
to obtain labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor, and a U.S.
worker with the same minimum qualification should not be able to perform the
same duties and serve the national interest to a similar degree.</font>
</font>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">4. The Applicant
Should Serve the U.S. National Interest Substantially Greater than the Other
Equally Qualified U.S. Workers</font></b>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The applicant should establish that
he or she will serve the national interest to a substantially greater degree
than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications. It
is not sufficient for the applicant simply to enumerate his or her
qualification, since the labor certification process might reveal that an
available U.S. worker has the qualification as well.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The applicant should explain how he
or she would serve the national interest to a substantially greater degree than
other individuals in the field. Emphasis should be placed on the overall value
and potential of the applicant’s individual contribution to the U.S., not the
fact that he or she is working in a field of high national interest.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">An applicant's record needs to
provide sufficient evidence that the work of the applicant has created national
benefits beyond that which could have been made by a fully qualified U.S.
worker, and the clear evidence of the applicant’s individual contributions to
national implications is required.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For NIW petition, an applicant must
show that his or her accomplishments could not be achieved by an equally
qualified U.S. worker, but the applicant does not need to demonstrate how his or
her abilities exceed those of every other researcher in the field.</font>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">5. Testimony from
Independent Experts</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The USCIS examiner's determination
relied heavily on the testimony of witnesses with varying degrees of connection
to the applicant. The letters of support from the expert witnesses who has
indirect connection with applicant are considered favorably, and the letters of
support need to prove that the impact of the applicant’s work stretched well
beyond the circle of colleagues who had worked with the alien directly.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The testimony from independent
established experts who knew the applicant mostly from his or her published work
may demonstrate that the applicant has significant national or international
attention.</font></p>

It Is Best to Provide not only Scholarly Articles, but also Include the
Citations by Others - </font></span><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A
</span>Citation Search Report&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
USCIS regularly held that unless there is evidence that independent researchers
have cited an applicant’s work, the authorship of scholarly articles is not
enough to show the applicant’s exceptional ability. To satisfy
this consideration, it is best to provide evidence of the authorship of scholarly
articles, the citation of the articles by other scholars, and the merit of the
publishing journals themselves.</font></span></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you mention your accomplishment in petition, USCIS adjudicator may not believe you. So you need
a <b><i><u>Citation Search Report</u></i></b> as one of your evidence, and you may provide impact factor for the journals where you published papers. In one
NIW case, the alien applicant has 6 publications that were never cited. The USCIS' respond is:
<i> "no citations means no recognition of your work."</i> This sounds reasonable. <br>
<br>
For NIW petitions, letters of recommendation are important but not sufficient. You must provide convincing evidences, and you can overcome the
requirements by demonstrating the importance of your research, journal papers, citations, patents, etc. You can also ask the referees to write letters stating that you are indeed recognized in your field.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For citation search tools, the <i>Google
    Scholar, Scopus, SciFinder,</i> and <i>ISI Web of Science </i>provide more citation search
    results. Also, if you have reviewed papers, you may have access to <i>Scopus</i>. </font></p>

<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">7. Be Sure to Emphasize the
Innovative Side of Your Work</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> The key issue for a National Interest Waiver
petition is how to collect evidence to
prove your work is in U.S. National Interest. Your work can be teaching or
management, and it does not have to be
research. It is a common understanding, however, that scientific
research and technology development keeps this country&#146;s
economy strong. So, be sure to emphasize the innovative side of
your work.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">D<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">o
not just attach evidence of awards, prizes, grants and fellowships. Your need to
set forth the criteria for the award and explain how the awards were in fact
based upon your past achievements. Award of NIH grants, for example, are based on the
review committee’s evaluation of not only the proposed project, but also the
individuals on the research team.</span></font></p>

State the Ways in Judge of Others’ Work</font></span></font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">To
successfully to prove your judging of others’ work, you should, if possible, submit a letter
from the editor of the journal that you have reviewed for, stating that you were
chosen as a peer reviewer based on your expertise in the subject matter.</font></span>
<font size="2">
Also, you <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">may want to state how the
ways in which you have acted as a judge of others’ work is qualitatively
different from others asked to serve as judges. For example, you can stressed
that you were specifically appointed by a chairman of the department to serve
on a panel reviewing candidates for a faculty position.</span></font></font></p>

<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">10. If You Do not Have a Few
Good Reference Letters</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you do not have a few good reference letters, you may
consider other methods of showing that experts in your field have recognized your work. For example, go into more detail about the journals which published your articles, perhaps
with a thorough discussion of the peer review process with notes about the types of experts chosen as manuscript
reviewers. Also talk at length about the actual or potential benefits of your work. Show statistics which paint a clear picture of the importance of your work.</font></p>

<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">11. If You Do not Have Many
Publications</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you want to apply for Green Card under NIW category, but do not have many
publications, it is not a problem. Having many publications are nice,
but not necessary for NIW. In fact, there are many applicants who do not have
many publications,
but have rather strong reference letters and have got their cases
approved. Remember, always try to emphasize the significance of
your work and your exceptional performance; do not be
discouraged about fewer publications.</font></p>

<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">12. Quote the Regulations
Directly to Spell out the Law&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">
    To help ensure that your case
    will not be wrongfully denied by inexperienced
    USCIS examiners, when writing the petition cover letter and/or reference letters,
    you should quote the regulations directly to spell out the law for a potentially less-than-informed
    adjudicator. That way the examiner should not be confused about language or
    requirements, and it will lead to accurate adjudications for the first try.
    </font>
    </p>

<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">13. Prevailing
Wage Is not an Issue for the NIW Petition</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since the
U.S. Department of Labor is not involved,
the &quot;prevailing wage&quot; is not an issue. Obviously, if the
salary offered is high, then the overall package will look better; if the salary offered is low, the applicant
will have to explain why he or she is earning substantially less
than that of his or her peers. If the answer is that the applicant is engaged in research at
an institution where similarly employed researchers are paid
similar salaries, then this should not be a problem. Also, if the
applicant is working for a non-profit institution, this may explain a low salary. The
USCIS will expect a
person working for a for-profit entity to earn a salary that is
equal to or higher than that paid to similarly qualified
professionals working for similar companies.</font></p>

<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">14. A PhD Degree Is Not
Required for NIW Petition</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you do not have a PhD degree, it is not a
problem. A PhD degree is not required for NIW petition. With regard to National
Interest Waiver, the law only demands an advanced degree or bachelor's degree
plus five years of work experience as the basic qualification. The difficult part is to show your work benefits
this country. Actually, many NIW applicants have master's degree, not PhD
degree. Therefore, Ph.D. candidates can apply under NIW.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">15. It Is Important to
    Determine the Appropriate Time to Petition for NIW Classification</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The
    USCIS may reject post-filing submissions of evidence. Petitioners must possess the necessary qualifications at the time of the original
    (or initial) petition. In some cases, if a petitioner can wait until after his/her important article published, his/her case
may be stronger.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">16. For the Field of
    Endeavor</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is
    important to strategically think about and identify the field of endeavor in which the petitioner is seeking
    exceptional ability and National Interest. Although the rule
    is to have the narrowest field possible (i.e. high energy elementary matter physicist vs. physicist), the
    USCIS might reject such a narrow categorization, and dismiss any evidence submitted in support of
    exceptional ability outside the narrow category.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">17. Avoid Statements
    that There Is a Shortage of U.S. Workers in Your Field</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">An area to avoid
    involves statements that there is a shortage of U.S. workers in your field.
    This will result in the USCIS examiner saying that you should definitely go
    through the Labor Certification process, not the NIW application.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">18. The Personality or
    Hard-working Nature of the Beneficiary</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The reference letter writers frequently find it
    is necessary to comment upon the personality or hard-working nature of the
    beneficiary. While such comments would be appropriate in other contexts,
    they are not relevant to the issue of the alien's exceptional ability. The
    alien's competency and expertise, as well as the significance of his/her
    work, should be evaluated by reference to objective facts to the fullest
    extent possible.

    Kickback” Strategy
    </font>
    </b><font color="#006666" size="2">&nbsp;
    </font>
    </font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">
Some applicants have reported that they follow a “play for the kickback” strategy of submitting a basic petition, holding back some evidence, and waiting for
a Request For Evidence (RFE) from USCIS. It is not recommended to follow this practice, because of the
problem of submitting documentation dated after the initial filing.
