    petition, an alien applicant should have <b><i>Exceptional Ability</i></b> in the sciences,
    engineering, arts or business, and have advanced degree (holding a Master or Doctor
    degree). To determine whether admitting an alien would be in the U.S. national
    interest, several factors may be considered, as listed at <a href="niw_whatis.htm" target="_blank"><font color="#006666">&quot;The Important Issues of National Interest Waiver Immigration Petition, Its Advantages, and Qualification Determination Factors.&quot;</font></a></font>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">To qualify for the criteria of
      <i><b>Exceptional Ability</b></i>, an alien applicant should at least meet
      three of the following six criteria:</font>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) An official academic record showing that the alien has a degree, diploma, certificate, or similar award from a college, university, school, or other institution of learning relating to the area of exceptional ability;</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2)
        Evidence in the form of letter(s) from current or former employer(s) showing that the alien has at least ten years of full-time experience in the occupation for which he or she is being sought;</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3)
        A license to practice the profession or certification for a particular profession or occupation;</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4)
        Evidence that the alien has commanded a salary, or other remuneration for services, which demonstrates exceptional
        ability. To satisfy this criterion, the evidence must show that the alien has commanded a salary or remuneration for services that is indicative of his or her claimed exceptional ability relative to others working in the field.</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5)
        Evidence of membership in professional associations; or</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">6)
        Evidence of recognition for achievements and significant contributions to the industry or field by peers, governmental entities, or professional or business organizations.</font>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">If the above standards do not readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence to establish the beneficiary's eligibility.</font><p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2.
      The
    Qualification Requirement for a National Interest Waiver Petition Petitions</font></b>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Typically, aliens who were successful in
    NIW petitions presented their cases by establishing themselves as having exceptional skill, experience, or
    knowledge which set them apart from their professional peers. But a NIW
    petition with documents simply stating a certain level of competence will not be sufficient to receive a National Interest
    Waiver approval. Rather, a proficiency that is greater than mere competence is expected
    for those seeking a National Interest Waiver petition approval.&nbsp;</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"> The important issue to keep in mind when applying for the
National Interest Waiver category is your exceptional ability which will benefit the U.S. National Interest. An applicant has to show that he or she is not the normal average individual in the field. Although it may take years of studying and training to be able to just participate in a field,
    but that is not enough. The applicant has to show that he or she truly stands out among the crowd in knowledge, skills, and
    talent.</font>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Additionally, recommendation
    letters included in a NIW petition package should testify the alien
    applicant's unique skill and experience, and the credentials of the individuals who write such letters will be reviewed
    by USCIS to determine whether they are qualified to make such evaluations.&nbsp;Also,
    the NIW applicants should be aware that the USCIS has become increasingly strict in its interpretation of what it considers to be in the national interest.</font>

    <p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3. The Critical Matters to Prove Your Exceptional Ability to Benefit U.S. National Interest</font></b>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In order to qualify for a National Interest Waiver petition, an alien
    applicant must demonstrate that the benefit of his or her activity to the nation is
    greater to outweigh the nation's interest inherent in completion of the Labor Certification process.
    Therefore, an alien applicant must satisfy all of the following requirements to obtain the National Interest
    Waiver:</font>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) the applicant seeks work in an area of substantial intrinsic merit; and</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2)
      the proposed work will benefit the nation as a whole; and&nbsp;</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3)
      The alien will serve the national interest to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications, and the national interest would be adversely affected if the alien is required of a labor certification.</font>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Generally speaking, the first criterion is the easiest to meet,
    most jobs have intrinsic value to U.S. national interest, and actually many jobs can be applied to national in
    scale.</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Also, an alien applicant must clearly
    demonstrate that the applicant's past record substantiates projections of future benefits to the U.S. national interest.&nbsp;An
    alien applicant must establish, in some capacity, his or her ability
    to serve the national interest to a substantially greater extent than a
    majority of his/her colleagues. An alien applicant should also demonstrate
    his or her
    influence on the field of employment.</font>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For researchers and engineers, publishing papers and articles is a common product of their
        work. But if an alien applicant can show that the publications have appeared in the
prestigious journals, this will help establish the alien as an exceptional applicant. Furthermore, if this
        applicant's work is commonly referred to and cited by other articles, or if he or she is frequently asked to sit on panels and review other people’s work, these
evidence will help demonstrate the qualifications as an exceptional alien.</font></p>

      <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Example 1:</font></b> <font size="2" face="Arial"> Dr. Wang is a
    post-doc researcher in civil engineering at a university in California. For
    the last three years, he had been working for the university in a H-1B status. Prior to come to U.S., he had worked for
      four years in a similar
    institute in his home country, China. He had co-authored several papers in
    the nationally recognized journals. His many years of experience and considerable success in the field of
    civil engineering and structural safety qualify him as a priority worker
    with exceptional ability, and he is working in an area of substantial intrinsic
    merit. His future work will benefit the nation as a whole by improving the structural safety and efficiency of
    bridge inspections, and reducing the costs associated with bridge classification and inspection. Because of his exceptional talent in his field, it can be expected that
      Dr.
      Wang’s research will result in greater contributions than those of most of his peers.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Example 2:</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial">
      As a research associate, Mr. Raj's work has been cited at least 80 times by
      his peer researchers, and he has extensive experience in the field of biomedical research, particularly in the area of molecular genetics research.
      Mr. Raj received his MS degree from one of the top schools on the East Coast
      of U.S., after earning his B.S. from the department of microbiology at one of the most prestigious schools in
      India. He has also conducted award-winning research at internationally recognized institutions like
      the School of Medicine at New York University, and his work has been published in such leading journals as
      <i>Genetic Science</i> and <i>The Journal of Bioscience</i>. Mr. Raj qualifies as an NIW candidate since the benefit of his proposed work is national in scope, and his research would be adversely affected if the
      Labor Certification process was required for Mr. Raj, because it is likely that
      his work will not progress as well without Mr. Raj’s exceptional
      contributions, considering the length of time it takes to process a Labor
      Certification.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For physicians applying for NIW, the
    qualified alien physicians should practice medicine in an area of the U.S. which is underserved.&nbsp;There are no absolute requirements as to who
    could qualify for a National Interest Waiver, but an alien physician must be able to demonstrate that
    he or she is seeking work in the area of substantial merit to the United States,
    and the approval of his or her Permanent Residence would be in the national interest; and delay or discontinuation of his/her activity due to the requirement of a Labor Certificate will adversely affects the national interest.&nbsp;</font></p>

    Detailed Requirements to Prove Your Exceptional Ability to Benefit U.S. National Interest</font></b>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Provide evidence that the benefits of your
    proposed employment will be in national scope. Your employment may be limited
    to a particular geographic area. However, you must establish benefit to more
    than one particular region of the country. Moreover, there should be little
    or no adverse impact on the interests of other regions of the country.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Submit evidence that you seek employment in an
    area of substantial intrinsic merit. Your employment must be important to
    the national interests of the U.S. Additionally, the benefits of your
    employment should be immediately apparent to the national interests of the
    United States.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Submit evidence related to your ability to
    perform the duties of the proposed employment position. To be considered in
    the national interest, you should show significantly above what
    necessary to prove the &quot;prospective national benefit&quot; required for
    all aliens seeking to qualify as &quot;exceptional.&quot; The exceptional is
    defined under USCIS regulations as <i> &quot;a degree of expertise
    significantly above that ordinarily encountered in the sciences, arts, or
    business.&quot;</i></font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You must persuasively demonstrate that the
    national interest would be adversely affected if a Labor Certification were
    required. You must demonstrate that it would be contrary to the national
    interest to potentially deprive a prospective employer of your services by
    making available to U.S. workers the position you seek. If self-employed,
    you must also establish that the national interest would be adversely
    affected if a Labor Certification were required.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You should establish that you are not seeking a
    national interest waiver based on a shortage of qualified workers in a given
    field, regardless of the nature of the occupation. The NIW is not warranted
    solely for the purpose of ameliorating a local labor shortage.</font></li>
</ul>

  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">If you demonstrate that you hold a patent or
    are responsible for an innovation, then you must demonstrate that the
