        was the first of its kind in the field of HTLV-1 research by using a

        demonstrated that activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptors on
        dendritic cells in a mouse model of psoriasis can reduce the skin
        inflammation and thus improve the psoriatic lesions. In particular, the
        reduction in inflammation was observed to be mediated through the
        decrease in the interleukin 17 producing inflammatory Th17 cells along
        with an increase in the regulatory T cells. Most importantly, my

        – human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) using a mouse model
        system during my PhD research at Emory University College of Medicine.
        This was the first study of its kind, since no prior study had been
        undertaken to explore this interaction. As human patients with HTLV-1
        are not able to clear the virus from their body in spite of
        anti-retroviral therapy, the goal of my study was to determine the early
        kinetics of dendritic cell immunity against HTLV-1. <o:p>

        dendritic cells. Through my research, I was able to compare cell-free
        and cell-associated HTLV-1 infection studies both in the absence and
        presence of dendritic cells. The transgenic mice which had been depleted
        of dendritic cells and infected with cell-free virus demonstrated
        enhanced levels of infection as measured by proviral load as well as
        increased gene expression of the viral protein Tax. In addition, such
        mice had very poor immune responses generated against the virus as
        measured by virus specific CD8 T cell response. My studies highlighted
        the importance of dendritic cells in mediating a strong anti-viral
        response against cell-free HTLV-1 and provided valuable scientific

        as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Merck, I have continued my research on
        dendritic cells in the autoimmune disease psoriasis. My studies have
        highlighted the importance of this cell type in being able to modulate
        the immune response upon activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptors
        and thus lead to the suppression of the inflammatory interleukin 17
        producing T cells while upregulating the anti-inflammatory regulatory T
        cells. Moreover, through my research I was also able to demonstrate that
        such activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptors on the dendritic cells
        can lead to the production of interleukin 10 and transforming growth
        factor &#946;, both of which are key anti-inflammatory cytokines. This

        that my research at Merck is in an area of substantial intrinsic merit,

        research on the immunology of autoimmune diseases and dendritic cells
        can have significant contributions to the healthcare and economy of the
        United States, and I have authored 13 excellent research articles which
        have been widely cited by other researchers in the field of immunology.
        Also, my articles were all published in highly prestigious peer-reviewed
        journals and I have also presented my research at various reputed
        national and international conferences. In addition, I have consistently
        received awards for my scientific achievements and also served as
        scholarly reviewer for a journal. I am an active member in good standing
