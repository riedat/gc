<p><font size="2" face="Arial">RE: Form I-140 Petition of EB2 National Interest
Waiver for Dr. Ming Lin</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Center Director:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This letter is written in support of Dr. Ming Lin's
immigration petition of EB2 the National Interest Waiver (Form I-140). I came to know
Dr. Lin and his scientific
research work in my capacity as a Director of the Sensors and Electron Devices
Directorate, at US Army Research Laboratory (ARL).&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Lin was a Ph.D. candidate in
the Electrical Engineering Department of the Stanford University. Through a
student exchange program at ARL, he has been working as a Research Associate in
the Electro-Optics/Znfrared (EO/IR) Image Processing Branch of the Signal and
Image Processing Division under my direction since January 2004. His research
is focused on the development of image/video compression algorithms for military
applications such as digitization of the battlefield.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Army Research Laboratory's Sensors and
Electron Devices Directorate (SEDD) is the principal Army organization for
research and exploratory development of electron device and sensor technologies
for Army battlefield applications. For the acquisition of digitized information,
such as the location and identification of military targets from a battle-space
through limited bandwidth channels, effective image and video compression
techniques are essential. These techniques are used to compress the battlefield
imagery, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR)
imagery, that contain targets. Developing efficient image/video compression
techniques is also related to the performance of the Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) technique that can actually locate and identify the targets.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A sad lesson learned by our armed forces during
the Operation Desert Storm is the inability to distinguish between the friendly
and hostile vehicles or equipment under poor visibility conditions.
Consequently, more than half of the American casualties were inflicted by the so
called &quot;friendly fires&quot;.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Certainly, we should not let the same tragedy
to occur again, To overcome similar problems in the future, we need Automatic
Target Recognition systems that are effective and efficient in
distinguishing enemy and friendly targets under adverse environmental
conditions. Currently, a number of ATR projects related to different military
applications are funded by the U.S. Army and the other branches. In the long run,
these efforts could significantly contribute to the safety of our troop and the
security of our nation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Lin has become a research associate in the
Electro-Optics/Infrared (EO/IR) Image Processing Branch of Army Research
Laboratory (ARL). He had been assigned to work on the Face Recognition
Technology (FERET) program which is sponsored by the Department of Defense
Counter-drug Technology Development Program Office, with ARL serving as the
technical agent. The primary mission of the FERET program is to develop
automatic face recognition capabilities that can be employed to assist security,
intelligence, and law enforcement personnel in the performance of their duties.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
In 2004, the major task of the FERET program, which is a government-monitored testing and
evaluation of face recognition technology using standardized database and test
procedures, was successfully performed. The availability of the FERET database
and evaluation methodology has made a significant difference in the progress of
developing accurate face-recognition algorithms.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Lin has been working on the development of the
FERET program in several areas, which include the active development of algorithms, the
availability of a large database of facial images, and a method for evaluating
the performance of face recognition algorithms. With his knowledge and
dedication, Dr. Lin has cultivated a number of successes in the FERET program. He
has designed novel, standardized evaluation algorithms and has developed several
innovative face recognition classifiers by integrating techniques, such as
vector quantization (VQ) and principal component analysis (PCA). His recent
experiments have shown some exciting results in terms of detection and
classification rates.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of face
recognition classifiers, Dr. Lin designed various projection-based techniques. His
face recognition classifiers have proved to work well on a large database of
facial images and to achieve a stabilized classification capability.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Working on the FERET project, Dr. Lin has made two
important contributions. The first contribution is a creative design of the
FERET database and evaluation methodology, thereby moving face recognition
technology entered into a new era. The second contribution is that the FERET
test has convinced the biometric community that face recognition is a key area
of scientific endeavor. In all these projects, Dr. Lin has worked actively and
independently.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Lin conducts the experiments thoroughly and produces appropriate
results in a timely manner. He has assisted other research efforts in the EO/IR
Image Processing Branch by giving insightful suggestions and sharing reusable
computer source code. His knowledge and experience in computer equipment and
system administration has benefited his colleagues and facilitated research
activities in this branch.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ATR projects are of great importance to ARL
and the Army due to their versatility in many military activities. An effective
ATR system that converts battlefield data into information for subsequent action
is a critical aid for our soldiers. The army and other services have allocated
sufficient resources for the development of ATR systems to maintain the
technological advantages of our military forces.&nbsp;He has published three journal papers in
prestigious <i>IEEE Journal of Image Technology</i>, and also presented his
research results at several national and international conferences.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">With
the skills and creativity that Dr. Lin has demonstrated in these projects, I
have no doubts that he will continue to do very well in the ATR field and in
other related research areas. He deserves to continue to work under optimal
circumstances, which at present, he can only find in the United States. I also
believe that Dr. Lin's work will certainly benefit U.S. scientific research and
military technology, hence </span>his research efforts will
benefit the security, strength, and prosperity of our nation.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> I hope this letter will fully
support his petition for Permanent Resident of United States.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sincerely yours,</font></p>
