The Qualification Criteria for Exceptional Ability and Advanced degree<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
An alien applicant may qualify for EB2 NIW preference classification if:&nbsp;</font></p>
    <blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) the alien
applicant has exceptional ability in the sciences, engineering, arts, or
business;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) the alien
      applicant is a member of the professions holding advanced degree;</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">3) the alien
applicant will substantially benefit prospectively the national economy, cultural or educational interests, or welfare of the United States, and&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">4) the alien's services are sought by an employer
and in the United States National Interest.&nbsp;</font></p>
    </blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">According to USCIS, the term "exceptional ability" is defined
as <i> "a degree of expertise significantly above that ordinarily encountered in the sciences, arts, or business.”</i>
This standard is lower than that for EB1 Aliens of Extraordinary Ability.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Advanced degree
means any United States academic or professional degree or a foreign equivalent
degree above that of baccalaureate. A United States baccalaureate degree or a
foreign equivalent degree followed by at least five years of progressive
experience in the specialty shall be considered the equivalent of a master's
degree. An alien can satisfy the advanced degree requirement by holding any of the following:&nbsp;</font></p>
    <blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) a U.S. master’s degree or higher, or a foreign degree evaluated to be the equivalent of a U.S. master’s degree or higher; or&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) a U.S. bachelor’s degree, or a foreign degree evaluated to be the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor’s degree, plus five years of progressive, post-degree work experience. An alien who does not possess at least a bachelor’s degree or a foreign equivalent degree will be ineligible for this classification.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The USCIS will exempt the requirement of a
    job offer, and thus of a Labor Certification, for aliens of exceptional
    ability in the sciences, engineering, arts, or business if exemption would
    be in the U.S. National Interest. To apply for the exemption, the petitioner
    must submit <b>Form ETA–750B, Statement of Qualifications of Alien,</b> in
    duplicate, as well as evidence to support the claim that such exemption
    would be in the U.S. National Interest.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Also, technically meeting the initial evidence requirement does not guarantee that the alien will be found to be an alien of
    exceptional
ability. Satisfying the above criteria does not guarantee that the USCIS will grant your
    NIW classification as an alien of exceptional ability. The USCIS looks for quality as well as quantity. As in
many other aspects of immigration law, comprehensive documentation of your qualifications is
very important.&nbsp;
