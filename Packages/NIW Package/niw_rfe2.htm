<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" face="Arial" size="2">1. How to Avoid
the Dreaded Request for Evidence</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Due to many factors including the weakened job market and slow economy, USCIS has responded by tightening nearly all employment-based
visa categories. For example, with the heightened scrutiny that the USCIS has placed on EB1 and EB2 applications, immigration community
reported Requests for Additional Evidence for even well-prepared cases. This USCIS practice has spilled over to the NIW category as
well. USCIS is now requiring NIW applicants to qualify under a stricter and more demanding standard.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">To avoid the Request for Evidence,
first and foremost, prepare your case carefully and discuss the standard with
your employer, and if possible, with your supervisor or mentor, to evaluate
whether the National Interest Waiver classification applies and whether the
necessary evidence can be gathered.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">You should tailor your petition to
the correct audience. Not all USCIS examiners are college educated, and none are
likely to be experts in your specialized field. Additionally, USCIS examiners
have a very limited amount of time to read all the materials in each petition -
less than 30 minutes in most cases. Therefore, you needs to present your
accomplishments and qualifications in plain English terms. This is especially
important in the peer recommendation letters and in the cover letter.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We have been told that USCIS
examiners are not impressed by the volume of material submitted; in fact, the
examiner might be more likely to set aside a particularly large submission in
favor of a shorter one. Be selective and include only the strongest evidence.<br>
<br>
The key point to remember in crafting a NIW petition is to establish your
current work is in U.S. national interest. Each piece of evidence should speak
to that standard.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" face="Arial" size="2">2. USCIS Will not
Approve a NIW Petition Simply Because the Alien Meets Basic Requirements</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Strange as it seems, some people who qualify for
EB1-Extraordinary Ability do not automatically qualify for the National Interest
Waiver category, even though the standards for NIW are basically lower than that
for EB1-Extraordinary Ability. It is therefore important to prepare
a Form I-140 petition for a person to file NIW petition, according to the statutory and regulatory guidelines in order to avoid a Request for Evidence:</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Ensure that all forms are completely filled out.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
2) Clearly document in the petition cover letter about how the individual is qualified for this eminent category.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
3) Ensure that the alien meets the NIW requirements. Although meeting the NIW
requirements would not guarantee an approval, but if an alien can not satisfy
the basic NIW requirements, it may be wise to consider
other category.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
4) Clearly document through evidence that the alien qualifies for each category.
Some examples of this are:&nbsp;</font></p>

  <blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">	(i) If the alien's articles are internationally published, provide copies of the published papers and circulation information proving that the journal is internationally published;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">	(ii) If the alien has received an award, show proof of the receipt of the award and then show the criteria for the award and why it is so important in that person's field;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">	(iii) If the alien is highly paid, show that he is paid more than the weighted average, by showing copies of salary surveys for that particular position.&nbsp;</font></p>

  </blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5) If this is an employer sponsored petition, document the employer's ability to pay through:</font></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">	Copies of Signed Corporate Federal Tax Returns;</font></li>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"> 	Copies of Audited Financial Statements; or&nbsp;</font></li>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">	If the company has over 100 employees, provide a signed statement from the Chief Financial Offer (not the Human Resources Department) documenting the
      petitioner's ability to pay.&nbsp;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">6) If this is a self-petition and
  without a job currently, document the following to demonstrate how the alien intends to support himself/herself through:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Offer of Employment or Contract;</font></li>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Proof of Current Assets.</font></li>
  </ul>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">7) Remember that the USCIS will not approve
a NIW petition simply because the alien meets the basic requirements. An alien
applicant must show that:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">the alien seeks employment in an area of substantial intrinsic
    merit;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">the benefits of the alien’s proposed employment must be national in
    scope;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">it would be contrary to the national interest to potentially deprive the prospective employer of the alien’s
    service by making available to U.S. workers the position the alien seeks.</font></li>
</ul>

    <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3. Standard Outlined by
    USCIS Requests for Evidence (RFEs)&nbsp;</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    <br>
    We can learn about USCIS standards from the language of RFEs. Even the
    best-prepared, strongest cases can get a RFE. USCIS often issues generic
    RFEs without identifying specific aspects of the case the petitioner can
    readily rectify. It is time-consuming to respond to and may be a source of
    frustration for the petitioner. USCIS RFEs often consist of merely restating
    statutory language and saying the petitioner has not met the burden of
    proof.&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For example, the current
    standard RFE language for NIWs states: <u>“Please submit copies of any
    published articles by other researchers citing or otherwise recognizing your
    research and/or contributions. . . . It is not necessary to submit articles
    that are self-referencing; i.e. written by you or your collaborators.”</u>&nbsp;</font>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The RFE may adds, <u>“Please
    submit documentary evidence to establish that you have a past record of
    specific prior achievement that justifies projections of future benefit to
    the national interest. You must establish, in some capacity, your ability to
    serve the national interest to a substantially greater extent than the
    majority of your peers. You must demonstrate, to some degree, your influence
    on your field of employment as a whole.”</u></font>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Please note three things from
    this NIW RFE applicable to all NIW cases:&nbsp;</font>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) The importance of
      independent citations and/or a large number of downloads. This can only be
      shown if one actually has some independent citations of one’s papers. If
      you do not have citations, you can show a download count of your papers or
      programs by other researchers. According to USCIS officers, many
      independent citations of an applicant’s papers or a large number of
      downloads of an applicant’s papers or programs prove the applicant’s
      work or achievement has a great impact on his/her field, and therefore
      serves US interests.&nbsp;</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) The importance of serving
      the national interest to a substantially greater extent than the majority
      of your peers. This can be shown by strong letters of recommendation
      testifying about an applicant’s achievements above his/her professional
      peers by providing specific examples of his/her unmatched achievements.</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3) An applicant’s influence
      on field as a whole. This can be shown by citations or commercialization
      of patents, but can also be shown by use of one’s work by others, which
      will be brought out by the letters of recommendation. For example, a U.S.
      Department of Agriculture Scientist can talk about how invaluable your
      research has been for USDA, and two professors who have never met you can
      talk about how your groundbreaking work influenced their published
      research, or an industry scientist at Monsanto can talk about your
      pioneering research techniques that Monsanto has adopted throughout
      California and Texas.&nbsp;</font>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">4. Standard
    Outlined by USCIS in Denial Notices - Actual Past Achievements</font></b>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We can also learn about USCIS
    standards from the language of denials. The language in denial notices also
    illuminates USCIS standards and expectations. Of course, just like RFEs,
    denials can be arbitrary. One USCIS officer may deny a case that other
    officers would have granted. Nevertheless, in denials there are patterns. A
    NIW petition with 15 first-authored publications and 130 independent
    citations has a higher chance of approval than a NIW petition with 2
    second-authored publications and 8 independent citations.&nbsp;</font>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><u><i><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Example:</font></b></i></u><font size="2" face="Arial">
      Here is relevant language from a denial notice of a case with 8
      first-authored papers but only 5 citations, and with reference letters
      that did not speak enough about actual past achievements:</font>
      <p align="left"><u><font size="2" face="Arial">“It must be noted that,
      while the national interest waiver hinges on prospective national benefit,
      it clearly must be established that the alien’s past record justifies
      projections of future benefit to the national interest. The petitioner’s
      subjective assurance that the alien will, in the future, serve the
      national interest cannot suffice to establish prospective national
      benefit.”&nbsp;</font></u><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
      <br>
      In other words, the emphasis of a successful NIW petition must be on
      actual past achievements, rather than speculative future benefits. USCIS
      judges a person’s capacity to contribute to the national interest in the
      future based on past achievements, not speculative claims about future
      potential. Thus recommendation letters should focus on substantial
      accomplishments and influence on the field that have already occurred
      rather than future anticipated benefits. As the USCIS denial notice
      states, <u>“The petitioner must demonstrate a past history of
      achievement with some degree of influence on the field as a whole.”&nbsp;</u><br>
      <br>
      USCIS faults the recommendation letters for not providing <u>“any
      examples of specific resources that they have adopted or expressed
      interest in adopting [petitioner’s] methodologies.” </u>USCIS adds, <u>“Although
      the petitioner’s research has helped in furthering current research
      projects, it has not been established this research has made a significant
      impact beyond the scope of a particular project.”&nbsp;</u><br>
      <br>
      Regarding the application with 8 first-authored articles and 5 citations,
      USCIS notes, <u>“The petitioner’s publication and citation history is
      not indicative of a significant influence within the field. . . . in order
      to establish eligibility, the petitioner must demonstrate that he already
      has a track record with some degree of influence on the field as a
      whole.”&nbsp;<br>
      </u><br>
      In other words, a large number of independent citations is clearly
      helpful. In the absence of such evidence, alternative sources of influence
      must be found to be able to show some degree of influence on the field as
      a whole.&nbsp;</font>

    NIW, and What You
  Should Do After Receiving the RFE</font></b></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In summary, the USCIS tends to
    focus and request evidence for the NIW to be:&nbsp;</font>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) specific past achievements
      instead of a general and future outlook;</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) many independent citations,
      or a large number of downloads of papers or programs;</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3) commercial utilizations of
      one’s patent or work; or&nbsp;</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4) any objective and
      documented achievements that show one’s achievements are above one’s
      peers.</font>
    </blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">When your NIW petition can not be immediately
adjudicated, a request for additional evidence will be sent to you.
