    Documents Needed for a National Interest Waiver </span>Petition</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Many accomplished foreign nationals have successfully obtained
their Green Cards in the National Interest Waiver
category. However, the standards are rigorous.
If you meet the qualification requirements, you will be able to avoid going through
a Labor Certification process or even not need to have a job offer, and you will be able to apply
for your Green Cad without the sponsorship of an employer.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
For those who have exceptional achievements in a field and work in a U.S.
national interest field, applying for Green Card in the National Interest Waiver category may be
their best choice. A <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">National Interest
Waiver</span> case can be petitioned through the USCIS Service Center which has
jurisdiction over the place of an applicant's residence, and the applicant must
provide several type of documents with the petition. An applicant should not
send original documents; photocopies of documents are acceptable.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For academics or researchers, evidence is needed<span style="COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">
    </span>in the form of letters and affidavits from prominent experts who can
confirm an applicant's scientific or scholarly contributions of significance to
the field. A case is strengthened by letters from outside an alien's current
community. The referrers should also outline their own standing in the field.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
Your
application package should includes:</font></p>

    </font>
<blockquote>
  <p style="MARGIN: 11.25pt 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 110%"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">1)
  A Cover Letter:</font></b> <font face="Arial" size="2"> This letter brings the evidence you are presenting
  together. First, a cover letter should explain your field of endeavor, and
  also explain what criteria should be considered to determine your excellence
  in a field, and your employment is important to
    the national interests of the United States. To be considered in
    the national interest, you should show significantly above what
    necessary to prove the &quot;prospective national benefit&quot; required of
    all aliens seeking to qualify as exceptional. Second, it should explain the evidence that you have provided with
  the application. Third, it should explain your current job, and how you keep
  on&nbsp; updating your professional skills, and prove that you are applying your skill that you are claiming the
  exceptional abilities to
  benefit the United States.</font></p>

  that it recommends you for exception abilities and your accomplishment in a U.S.
  nation interest field. The person writing the letter should give an introduction
  about himself or herself, and then give reference to your research and
  professional work, its importance, and how it sets you apart from other peers.
  Also, it should mention how beneficial it would be for U.S. national interest
  if your immigration petition is approved.</font></p>
