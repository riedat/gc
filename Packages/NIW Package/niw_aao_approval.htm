    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">USCIS' Administrative Appeals Office (“AAO”) is the adjudicating tribunal that sits directly above the four USCIS
      Service Centers. AAO has appellate jurisdiction on over 40 different types of immigration petition including NIW based I-140 petition.
      When an NIW petition is denied and an appeal is filed, AAO adjudicates the final ruling on the case. These decisions provide
      guidance for immigration officers in the correct interpretation of immigration law, regulations and policy.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We have conducted a careful analysis of some typical NIW appeal cases published by AAO. These rulings provide an excellent
      overview of the criteria that USCIS considers when adjudicating an NIW application.
      The following is an analysis of 4 NIW petitions which were denied by USCIS
      Service Centers initially, but finally approved by AAO after appeal.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font color="#006666">1. AAO Approved - Detailed Case Analysis for a Microbiologist</font></b><br>
      <br>
      This case was originally denied by the USCIS Nebraska Service Center (NSC). The petitioner held a
      MS in Microbiology from the University of Minnesota. The petitioner’s work focused on researching methods to detect the Avian Pneumovirus (APV), which at
      the time was damaging the U.S. turkey industry. AAO sustained the appeal and approved this case because of the practical
      benefit derived from the petitioner’s research.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Letters from such organizations as the Minnesota Turkey Research and Promotion Council touted the importance of the
      petitioner’s diagnostic tests for detecting APV in infected turkeys. This had a direct impact on turkey farming in the U.S.
      since Minnesota is one the largest turkey processors in the nation. AAO also pointed to the numerous fellowships that the
      petitioner acquired, as well as petitioner’s moderate citation record.<br>
      <br>
      Interestingly, AAO also emphasized a letter from the Canadian Veterinary Infections Disease Organization that explained that it
      had sent one of its research scientists to the University of Minnesota to acquire genomics tools and technology under the
      petitioner’s guidance and expertise. This shows that letters from foreign government funded agencies can have some persuasive
      effect in determining whether an applicant’s achievements are above those typically found in a U.S. worker with the same
      minimum qualifications.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#006666"><b>2. AAO Approved - Detailed Case Analysis for a Physicist</b></font><br>
      <br>
      This case was originally denied by the Vermont Service Center (VSC). The petitioner held a PhD in Physics from Moscow State
      University. For his NIW petition, the petitioner had submitted evidence that he had thirty-one citations to his peer-reviewed
      articles along with recommendation letters from researchers he had worked with as well as independent researchers in the field.
      VSC denied his petition and dismissed the citation evidence based on the grounds that “scientists are legally and ethically
      required to cite any other researchers’ work.”&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      VSC also dismissed the recommendation letters because of the lack of evidence demonstrating that the authors were “considered
      leading experts in the beneficiary’s field of endeavor.”<br>
      <br>
      AAO sustained the appeal and approved the case. It pointed out that even though scientists are obligated to cite sources, this
      does not detract from the fact that the petitioner’s work was relied upon by other researchers. AAO also ruled that there was
      no need for external evidence of expertise in the field from the letter authors since the letters had attached curriculum vitae
      and the letters were written on official organization letterhead. Interestingly, AAO also pointed out that, while not
      sufficient evidence by itself, “requests from three separate peer reviewed journals soliciting reviews by the petitioner is&nbsp;<br>
      consistent with his influence in the field.”</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font color="#006666">3. AAO Approved - Detailed Case Analysis for a
      Solid Mechanics Researcher<br>
      </font></b><br>
      This case was also originally denied by CSC. The petitioner held a Ph.D. in Engineering from a University in China. The
      petitioner’s work focused on improving the ability to simulate damage to an aircraft by developing a software package that
      allowed for sophisticated damage tolerance analysis and safe-life estimation methodology.<br>
      <br>
      AAO sustained the appeal and approved the case because of the real-world practical applications from his research. Due to the&nbsp;
      intellectual property issues and patent rights, engineers may not have the extensive publication lists and citations to their
      work that are possible with the other sciences.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      AAO pointed out in this case that evidence such as licensing agreements and affirmations from government and industry officials
      can also be considered. In fact, the petitioner only had two published articles in peer-reviewed journals with no citations.
      This appeal was heavily dependent on the quality of the letters of recommendation.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The authors for these letters included the Chief Scientist at Galaxy Scientific Corporation and a senior scientist at the U.S.
      Army Research Office who all licensed and utilized the petitioner’s software. AAO pointed out that in engineering cases,
      letters from clients are more persuasive evidence than letters from collaborators in the field.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#006666"><b>4. AAO Approved - Detailed Case Analysis for an
      Information System Analyst<br>
      </b></font><br>
      This case was originally denied by the California Service Center (“CSC”). The petitioner held a
      MS in information Management Systems from the University of California at U.C. Berkeley. The petitioner’s work dealt specifically with data mining by
      extracting consumer information from various databases to detect fraud, possible terrorist activity, and improve consumer&nbsp;<br>
      activity predictions.<br>
      <br>
      AAO approved this case because of the quality of the authors of the letters of recommendation. Of particular interest is that
      all of the authors mentioned by AAO were from private companies such as IBM, PeopleSoft and E.piphany - this shows that for the
      engineering field, letters from private industry can be particularly persuasive, and it is not always necessary to get letters from universities or public agencies.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The petitioner also had ten citations to his published works, along with evidence that his work was frequently downloaded from the U.C. Berkeley website. AAO also pointed out that CSC was in error for requiring a showing of “urgency” for an NIW waiver.</font></p>
