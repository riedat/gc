substantial intrinsic merit and in U.S. national interest. Over the last two decades, the research and development on nanotechnology have kept growing.
The former president William J. Clinton signed the National Nanotechnology Initiative, “the administration is making this major new initiative, called the National Nanotechnology Initiative, a top science and technology priority. These developments of nanotechnology are likely to change the way almost everything—from vaccines to computers to automobile tires to objects not yet imagined—is designed and made.”

the research is driven by the need to improve the functionality of materials. For example, there has been a significant amount of research directed at developing “self-healing”
materials, biological structures which have the ability to reconstruct naturally. However, all manmade materials experience some form of failure
- glass can crack, rubber can break down, etc. By applying nanotechnology to materials manufacturing, the self-healing that occurs in biological structures can potentially be simulated in manmade structures. </font></p>

In terms of electronics and computing, nanotechnology has the potential to have a big impact. Potential applications include the expansion of increasingly greater amounts of data storage on an increasingly smaller scale, and the synthesis of all components related to computer technology, including wiring and connecting. One specific example is a chip embedded in the wall of a structure that controls the operational demands of the homeowner or guest (e.g. with the flip of a switch, the color of the wall could change to fit the individual’s
choice).</font></p>

Increasing the efficiency of these areas through nanoelectronics will help to improve the gathering of information, as well as the distribution of
information. Other nanotechnology-driven defense applications currently underway include: the collection, transmission, and protection of information; high-performance, high-strength, lightweight military platforms; chemical, biological, and nuclear sensors for homeland protection; nanomechanical and micromechanical devices for control of nuclear and other defense systems; virtual reality systems based on nanoelectronics for effective training; and increased use of automation and robotics.</font></p>

United States is the study of heat transport and energy conversion in materials and electrical devices at the

can be found in the development of increasingly efficient technologies. For example, with nanotechnology as an enabling technology, fuel consumption rates for automobiles and airplanes will improve, and lighting will become more efficient. Standard light bulbs currently only yield a seven to eight percent
energy conversion rate, meaning that more than 90 percent of the energy going into a light bulb is wasted. Nanotechnology has the potential to change
that. </font></p>

this method is a feat that is unattainable using conventional lithographic techniques.
.....One problem with nanoscale devices is the difficulty of fabricating and attaching electrodes to their inputs and outputs. Given the diminutive size of single-molecule devices, in particular, researchers may find it challenging enough just to pinpoint the device's location, much less attach an electrode. The
Stanford researchers call their technique on-wire lithography (OWL). The resultant structures
will allow one to build all sorts of molecule-based devices that will allow one to uncover the fundamental secrets of electrical transport in molecules and develop a variety of new and powerful optical and biological sensors.&quot;

  &quot;Molecular electronics aims to build functional devices on the scale of individual molecules.

  The method, called on-wire lithography, is reported by
