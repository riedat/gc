  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">RE: Form I-140 Petition of EB2 National Interest Waiver for Dr.
  Keying Yoon</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Sir or Madam:<br>
        <br>
        It is with enthusiasm that I support Dr. Keying Yoon's immigration petition as well as for National Interest Waiver. I hold a tenure track position as Associate Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the
        Emory University College of Medicine. I have also been given a joint appointment in the Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease as well as the
        Emory Institute for Biotechnology and Virology Research within the Emory
        University School of Medicine. As a full-time faculty member of the Department and the Institute, my responsibilities involve research, teaching, and services.<br>
        <br>
        I have known Dr. Yoon for the last seven years and also served as his thesis advisor during his doctoral training in my laboratory. Dr.
        Yoon completed his MS in Biotechnology from the renowned Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, Korea. He worked for a year at the National Institute of Immunology in Korea
        before he was accepted into the Microbiology and Immunology Department at
        Emory University College of Medicine with full scholarship and stipend. In my laboratory, Dr.
        Yoon took upon the task of starting a completely new and challenging study, which involved the development of a mouse model for the human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) disease. He was actively involved in the conceptualization, designing and setup of the project. During the course of his study,
        he compared cell-free and cell-associated forms of chimerical HTLV-1 in his transgenic mouse model and demonstrated critical findings regarding the role played by the host
        dendritic cells in mounting a protective immune response against cell-free recombinant HTLV-1.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> This finding has offered a new perspective on our understanding of the role of
        dendritic cells in the field of human retro virology. Dr. Yoon also demonstrated the mechanism by which the
        dendritics cells interact with cell-free chimerical HTLV-1 and demonstrated how the
        dendritic cells respond to the viral challenge through the activation of various interferon stimulation genes, cytokines,
        chamomiles and signaling molecules. Both these studies demonstrated for the first time the critical role of
        dendritic cells during the early stage of host-virus interaction in a (his) mouse model system for HTLV-1. These significant findings were published by Dr.
        Yoon in the peer-reviewed and prestigious journal of the field i.e. <i> Journal of Immunology,
        Plops One, Journal of Leukocyte Biology</i>, etc, and have been cited many times by researchers in the field all over the world.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Yoon’s research is in an area of substantial intrinsic merit, and his outstanding research work will benefit the nation as a whole. Therefore, Dr.
        Yoon’s research results were well received by the National Institute of Health and awarded a $500,000 grant (R21
        AI097831-01) to further develop, understand and study the mechanism of dendritic
        cell interaction with the human virus using the mouse model system. The renewed support by
        NIH for continued research in this direction validates the significance and valuable contribution by Dr.
        Yoon in the field of human retro virology and immunology, and it further indicates that Dr.
        Yoon’s research work is in U.S. national interest.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Yoon’s outstanding accomplishment has been well recognized by the scientific
        communicate. Dr. Yoon has a commendable publication record, having already published 9 manuscripts in top tier peer reviewed journals with another in press. He is listed as first author on most of them. Moreover, his published work has been well cited by various research groups from many nations.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Yoon has also presented his scientific research at many top niche national and international conferences of very high repute, thereby receiving recognition by the scientific community at large. In addition, he has also delivered oral presentations at the 9th International Symposium on
        Neurobiology in 2011 where he earned the best oral presentation award, as well as at the 19th Annual Infection and Immunity Forum in
        2012.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Due to the significant nature of Dr. Yoon’s research findings and his achievements, it is not surprising that he was offered postdoctoral position immediately after graduation in premier academic research laboratories at Harvard University, Brown University, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences as well as from industry including Johnson &amp; Johnson and
        Merck.<br>
        <br>
        In conclusion, Dr. Yoon’s research on understanding the role of dendritic
        cells in human diseases is critical to the interests of the United States and healthcare of this country. Therefore, Dr.
        Yoon’s research on dendritic cell mediated immunological mechanism of autoimmune diseases is in the national interest of the United States, and the proposed benefit of his research will benefit the whole country and is thus national in scope. I highly recommend that his petition for immigration with National Interest Waiver be approved so that he may continue his research in full earnest. Please feel free to contact me if you need any further information.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Kind regards.<br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
