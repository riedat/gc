    NIW Application and the Requirement of Reference
    Letter&nbsp;</font></b></p>

    <blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;<b><i>Hi</i></b>, my name is Louisa and I
am a Post-Doc research fellow at a prestigious university in United States. I am interested in filing for
a Green Card application in NIW. I have done extensive research in biomedical engineering.
Most cell cultures are grown on flat surface and I developed the technique to grow endothelial cells (the cells on the inner lining of
blood vessel) on a tubular structure, a more physiologically realistic model for blood vessels. This is a significant step forward
for scientists investigating cardiovascular diseases on blood vessel, the leading cause of death in the USA.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"> The cost of isolation of a blood vessel is high and labor intensive. However, up until now,
it was the only way to get endothelial cells on a tubular structure. Not only would my technique benefit scientist and patients, it would
also save many animals from unnecessary scarifications. Based on the results of my study,
I have filed two intellectual properties disclosures and waiting for patent submissions from my
university's office of intellectual properties.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Also, as my studies suggested, delivering
high blood flow rate can lead to the failure of AV access. Physicians can only implant up to 5
accesses in a patient and if all of them fail, the patient runs out of options.
Furthermore, the cost of implantation is very high. So if we can
prolong the access life by lower blood rate delivery, we can save many patients lives.
There is a demand to re-design the dialysis needle to lower the level of turbulence. Most for-profit entities would not be interested in
this kind of investment due to the low return rate.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">I need to submit a grant for NIH to further study the effects of
needle turbulence on animal models. In the mean time, I also need government support to ask the dialysis units lowering the blood rate
delivery and see if that would improve access life. I also need to perfect my technique of culturing cells on a tube so
that it can be a sufficient substitution of a real blood vessel. I would only need a year to perfect this technique and it might be ready
for commercialization.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"> However, being a foreigner, I am banned from most of government grants.
Therefore, I want to apply for Green Card in the NIW category. But first, I want
to know more from you about the requirement of reference letter, and do I really
need them for my NIW application? Thank you.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. The
Confusion
about the Reference Letters in a NIW Petition</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">There is some confusion
about the reference letters (recommendation letters or supporting letters) in a
NIW petition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
When the Immigration Act of
1990 went into effect, the NIWs were largely unused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Most people who applied for Green Cards <o:p>without job offers chose to
use the &quot;Alien of Extraordinary Ability&quot; category which had more
understandable <o:p>regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In the early years, some
minimally qualified applicants were
approved in the extraordinary ability <o:p>category.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>As the number of applications rose, the INS
(now named as USCIS) tightened that category up
and applicants began resorting to <o:p>the NIW category.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">With the NIW application numbers
continue to
rise, the USCIS takes different actions.<o:p>
</o:p>First, the USCIS stated that if
a person were of the requisite level of ability, he or she should be able to get
<o:p>reference letters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This sounded reasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>After
all, if a person were applying for a job, the employer would <o:p>likely want references.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The result was that everyone
acquired reference letters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The second USCIS move was to
say that the reference letters had to be of a specific type.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>They had to be from independent <o:p>sources and should not be
from referrers who came from the same country as the applicant. There were a lot of <o:p>problems with these
statements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>First, it favored
applicants who were well-connected to professors and researchers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>This is not exactly a sign
of exceptional ability. Second, it
cut out referrers from the person's home country who <o:p>could best comment on the
applicant's work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The USCIS backed
away from this stance later, although a few examiners still believe that is
reasonable.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The third and the most
important step was the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT)
decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The NYSDOT wished to get a
Green Card for a civil engineer who was involved in designing and retrofitting
bridges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The <o:p>NIW was a popular
alternative to Labor Certification Green Cards because it was faster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Many employers initiated <o:p>both processes and then if
an NIW were approved, they dropped the Labor Certification based application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
&nbsp;
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The problem with this case <o:p>was that the NYSDOT appealed
the denial of the NIW.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The USCIS appeals branch used this case to set up a new standard <o:p>for NIWs. The
USCIS settled into more
reasonable interpretations of the NYSDOT tests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Now, the
USCIS has three tests
for a NIW petition (please see <a href="niw_whatis2.htm" target="_blank"><font color="#006666">The Significance of Three-prong Test for a Successful NIW Approval, and the Differences and Similarities of NIW and EB1 Petitions</font></a>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In this situation,
reference letters can be used as supporting evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3. The
Reference Letters Should be Written and Used as Supporting Evidence for Your Petition</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The reference letters should be
written and used as supporting evidence for your NIW petition. The most important rule is that there is no proper format for the reference letters. In fact, if you get more than one reference letter, they should be of varying formats. The worst thing to do is
to obtain several reference letters which are all "clones."  The USCIS examiners will believe that these letters were actually prepared by the applicant, rather than by
the referrers.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The reference letters should be used
properly as your supporting evidence. Some applicants have been writing the letters themselves and
then having the referrers sign them. This has led to large numbers of letters which all look the same. They contain the same
comments and use the same statements about exceptional ability or U.S. national interest.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
While the USCIS examiners are not highly trained in the applicants' fields, they can easily recognize that such letters are rarely the product of the
referrers. This has led some examiners to increase the standards of the reference letters, i.e. asking for letters from
U.S. government agencies and independent experts.  No one wins when USCIS examiners
ask for such stringent evidence, so it is important that reference letters be used with care.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Generally, reference letters should be written by the referrer, so that the USCIS examiner can see
the differences, even if they are only grammatical
differences and personal touches. In one previous case, a USCIS Service Center received five reference letters
from an applicant and they were all strong, but they were all written by the applicant and signed by the referrers. They were rendered useless because they contained the same repeated grammatical errors.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"> It is suggested that an applicant should obtain drafts and then discuss them
with the referrers. One thing to keep in mind is that the USCIS examiners have seen hundreds of letters, and they can tell which
ones are simply
applicant-cloned products. There is no number of reference letters you must get.
Three strong reference letters are better than 10 average letters.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">4. USCIS Adjudicator's View of the Reference Letters</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"> Almost all NIW petitions contain reference letters, and reference letters should form the cornerstone of a successful claim for the
EB2 National Interest Waiver classification. The statements made by the referrers should be corroborated by documented evidence in the record. The letters should explain in specific terms why the referrers believe the beneficiary to be of
Exceptional Ability caliber.<br>
<br>
Letters that merely reiterate USCIS’ NIW definitions, or make general and expansive statements regarding the beneficiary and his or her accomplishments, are generally not persuasive. The relationship or affiliation between the beneficiary and the referrers is also a factor to consider when evaluating the significance of the referrers’ statements. It is generally expected that an
accomplished individual should&nbsp; receive recognition well beyond the circle of personal and professional acquaintances. <br>
<br>
Certain testimonials written by other individuals working in the alien’s field of endeavor may be submitted as evidence. In some cases, such testimonials merely make general assertions about the alien, and at most, indicate that the alien is a competent, respected figure within the field of endeavor, but the authors fail to support such statements with sufficient concrete evidence. These reference letters may be considered by USCIS, but do not necessarily show the beneficiary’s claimed
ability. In some cases, USCIS examiners may request letters from truly independent sources, i.e. people who do not know the applicant at all. This was seen as unreasonable by almost all observers in the immigration community.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">5. Other Issues about the Reference Letters</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"> There are many issues to be addressed about the reference letters. The reference letters are not required by USCIS, but they can be very useful, and most USCIS examiners for EB1 and NIW applications expect them. <br>
<br>
Some applicants may try to avoid the reference letters for confidentiality purposes, but for others, they are easy to obtain. A more thorough compilation of background materials can offset an absence of good reference letters. These materials may include statistics about the area of research, information about professional organizations, awards, journals, etc. <br>
<br>
Some professional societies usually do not provide reference letters for their members. In addition, some U.S. government agencies will simply not prepare a reference letter if asked. Therefore, the request of reference letters or “independent letters” heavily favors applicants with connections at government agencies or in professional societies, which may be seen as unfair for some
applicants.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"> The NIW petition is always evolving. The USCIS continues to develop novel interpretations of specific sections of the regulations, so this category will continue to require extensive knowledge of USCIS actions. A review of approved petitions leads us believe that there is no specific pattern for professional fields of successful applicants. This is actually good news, because it probably points to a slight loosening of the
NIW reins.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">6. Things
that the Referrers Should Not Discuss</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Are there things that the
referrers should not discuss?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  Yes, t</span>here are several
areas which should not be included into the reference letters. Primarily, an area to
avoid involves statements that there is a
shortage of U.S. workers in your field. This will result in the USCIS examiners saying that
you should definitely go through the Labor Certification process, not the NIW application.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="2" face="Arial">Also,
if you were a </font></span><font size="2" face="Arial">Teaching Assistant or Research
Assistant in
a graduate school, the reference letters should avoid concentrating only on your work as a teaching or research assistant while in graduate school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
USCIS </span>examiners will likely say that such information does not distinguish you
from other graduate students.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The referrers frequently find it
    is necessary to comment upon the personality or hard-working nature of the beneficiary.
    While such comments would be appropriate in other contexts, they are not relevant to the issue of whether a particular immigration benefit should be granted.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">7. An
    Example of How to Get Reference Letters form People in a National Lab or a
    Government Agency</font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><u><font size="2" face="Arial">Example:</font></u></i></b>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">
    I want to apply for NIW soon. My friend told me that U.S. regulation 18 USC
    § 205 does not allow a federal agency or employee to write a letter in
    favor of an alien's immigration. My work helps the National Labs, and I know
    a letter from them will be a good one and help my petition.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">How can I handle this
    situation? Do you have any suggestions? Can they write a letter just
    mentioning that my works helps them, without even mentioning about me - if
    that is done, will it be useful for USCIS? Would letters with no government
    letterhead have any weight or consideration for the USCIS' adjudicators?&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The reason I ask this question is that it is difficult for most of my
    referees at federal agencies or national labs to write it on a government
    letterhead, so I am little confused. Thank you for your opinion and
    experiences I really need it.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><u><font size="2" face="Arial">Case Analysis:</font></u></i></b>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">
    A criminal statute, 18 USC § 205, prohibits a federal employee from making
    representations on behalf of another before or to a federal entity, except
    in relation to federal employment. Different agencies interpret this
    differently.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Just remember, not all
    people who work for such federal establishment fall under this clause. You
    can ask them - if they are not allowed, they will say so. Many alien
    applicants were able to get reference letters from different national labs.
    Yes, they may not be allowed to write one - but they can always write a
    &quot;<i>personal professional opinion</i>&quot;, which means they would not
    print it on a letterhead, but otherwise it will be the same. The reference
    letters do not need to be on the agency's letterhead, but the writer should
    enclose a CV with the reference letter.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Although not applicable in
    every case, a general information is that a national lab scientist does not
    mean he or she is a federal employee. We know this as many workers in
    national labs are contractors, not federal employees. National labs are
    something called GOCO, which means “<i>government owned, contractor
    operated.</i>&quot; So, some of them may be able to write these letters on
    their letterheads.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The following is a strategy
    used by one alien applicant to get reference letters in a national lab:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;When I first asked
      one person, he was hesitant - I convinced him by showing him another
      letter written by his colleague for another applicant...that way, he
      became comfortable with writing one. In fact, one senior person, who is
      close to retirement, printed it on a government letter head, saying he
      could not care less about such rule...so, try senior people or even ones
      just retired.&quot;</font></p>
