    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
Question: My I-140 NIW petition was denied recently. The USCIS officer did not agree that
the national interest would be adversely affected if a Labor Certification were
required. The reasons were described in detail as below:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><u><font size="2" face="Arial">
&quot;An overall view of the record
suggests that the beneficiary has played an important role in the activities. However, the evidence presented does not
establish that the petitioner is the primary motivator behind projects.&quot;</font></u></p>
      <p><u><font size="2" face="Arial">
&quot;A petitioner seeking the waiver must
persuasively demonstrate that he will serve the national interest to a
substantially greater degree than an available U.S. worker having the same
qualifications.&quot;</font></u></p>
      <p><u><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;However, original contributions,
publications and presentation of research work are inherent to the position of a
researcher. The fact that the alien was successful in his endeavors is not
necessarily sufficient to meet the national interest threshold.&quot;</font></u></p>
    </blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Do you think I should appeal the denial or
re-file a new NIW I-140?&nbsp; I have no idea about how to write a letter to
argue with the above points, and the timing frame for appeal is also very
short.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. Appeal a Denied National Interest Waiver
Petition</font></b></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial"> The
    USCIS presumes that it is in the U.S. national interest for most foreign nationals seeking
    Green Cards to undergo Labor Certification. The Labor certification is a competitive recruitment process, where the U.S. employer demonstrates to the U.S. Department
    of Labor that the employer has not been able to find a qualified U.S. worker to perform the same job duties as the foreign
    national.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">Typically, before the
    USCIS issues a denial in a NIW case, it first sends a Request for Evidence (RFE). Receipt of an RFE enables the candidate the opportunity to present additional evidence, for a
    fair and accurate determination. This procedure is in keeping with the purpose of the NIW - to create an avenue to obtain
    permanent resident status for a candidate who demonstrates that her or his work will substantially benefit the U.S.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">When your NIW petition is
denied by the USCIS, that decision can be appealed to a higher authority for
review. In immigration proceedings, the appeal review authority is divided
between two separate government agencies:&nbsp;</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">1)
      the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) within the USCIS; and&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">2)
      the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), under the jurisdiction of the
      Executive Office of Immigration Review, United States Department of
      Justice.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">Only
    the person who submitted the original petition may file the appeal. The
    petitioner alone has standing to appeal the denial of the immigration
    application. If an appeal is filed with AAO, that appeal will be reviewed by
    AAO to see if the grounds of denial have been overcome. If so, the appeal should be treated as a motion and the case
    will be approved.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
    person appealing the decision may also be represented by an attorney or
    representative. If the petitioner is represented, the appeal must be
    accompanied by a properly executed USCIS Form G-28 (Notice of Entry or
    Appearance as Attorney or Representative). The Form G-28 must be signed by
    both the attorney or representative and the person who filed the original
    application.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3.
    How to Appeal the Denial</font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">If your petition was
denied by USCIS and you believe that your NIW case is strong, you can choose to
appeal. The USCIS <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Administrative
Appeals Office</span> will evaluate your appeal carefully, and then make
the final decision.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
If you think your NIW case is strong enough, you can file an appeal. Otherwise,
you can re-file NIW and/or try other immigration categories such as EB1-EA (Extraordinary
Ability), EB1-OR (Outstanding Researcher or Professor), or even Labor Certification.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
The
    time frame for an appeal is short. There are strict deadlines that must be
    met to properly file an appeal. The appeal must be filed with the correct
    fee at the USCIS Service Center that made the original decision. You may
    file an explanation in support of the appeal. After review, the appeal
    authority may</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">1)
      agree with you and change the original decision;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">2)
      disagree with you and affirm the original decision; or&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">3)
      send the case back to the original office for further action.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">If
    your Form I-140 immigration petition is denied, you should carefully review
    the written decision that is issued by the USCIS to determine whether you
    may appeal the denial of your application. The USCIS' decision notice will
    inform you of the reasons for the decision, notify you of the proper
    appellate jurisdiction (such as AAO), and the applicable deadlines, and
    provide you with the correct USCIS form information to file an appeal.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">If
    you desire to appeal the denial of an application, the notice of appeal must
    be filed within 30 days of the date of the decision. If you receive the
    decision by mail, you must file the appeal within 33 days of the date of the
    decision.<br>
    <br>
    If the Administrative Appeals Office has jurisdiction over the decision, the
    notice of appeal must be filed on <b><i>Form I-290B - Notice of Appeal or Motion</i>.</b>
    You file this form to notify USCIS that you are appealing an adverse decision regarding your case. The appeal must be filed with the USCIS
    Service Center that made the original decision. An explanation may be filed
    in support of your appeal. The fee must be included, and the successful appeal rate is small.</font></p>
