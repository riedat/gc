        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Re: Dr. Praven Gurpur – Application for
        Permanent Residency<br>
        <br>
        Dear Sir or Madam:<br>
        <br>
        I am pleased to write this support letter, in favor of Dr. Praven
        Gurpur’s application for permanent residency in the United States, in
        the EB1-Extraordinary Ability category.<br>
        <br>
        I am currently Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Assistant Dean
        of Graduate College of Biomedical Sciences at the Western University of
        Health Sciences, Pomona CA. I obtained my PhD in Pharmacy from the
        University of Alberta, Canada. My expertise is in the area of liposomal
        drug delivery and solid dosage forms. Having obtained research and
        development grants from the federal agencies as well as 10 pharmacy companies, I continue to be instrumental in the formulation and
        development of several products on the market. I am also active in
        teaching pharmaceutics, pre-formulation, product development and novel
        drug delivery systems at Master’s and PharmD levels. I have published
        more than 60 research papers, presented more than 100 papers and hold
        four U.S. patents. I have co-edited the book – Liposome Drug Delivery.
        Some areas of my research interest include site-specific drug delivery
        using liposomes and monoclonal antibodies; controlled release
        formulations based on long circulating liposomes and polymeric delivery
        systems; and enhancement of bioavailability using lipid based delivery
        systems and evaluation in Caco-2 cell model.<br>
        <br>
        I am one of the Advisors and the Principal Investigator of collaborative
        clinical research projects, with en-N-tech / N-terminus Research
        Laboratory in Pomona, CA. The projects are focused on the development of
        specialized dietary supplements called ‘bio-replenishments’. Dr.
        Gurpur is a Lead Scientist at en-N-tech / N-terminus who has recently
        conducted clinical safety and efficacy studies of a bone health
        bioreplenishment in post-menopausal women.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Gurpur earned his doctorate (PhD) in bio-physical chemistry from the
        Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in New Delhi, India. Dr. Gurpur has
        extensive research experience in the areas of thermodynamics of
        bio-molecular interactions, drug development and molecular
        self-assembly, through his assignments at the Indian Institute of
        Science, Beckman Research Institute at the City of Hope National Medical
        Center, Baylor University and Louisiana Tech University in the USA. Dr.
        Gurpur is currently a Senior Research Scientist at en-N-tech /
        N-terminus Research Laboratory, a research-based biotech company located
        in southern California. He has published 15 high quality articles in
        international, high-impact journals and authored 3 book chapters. He has
        3 patents and presented his work in several national and international
        conferences, and he is really at the top of the field.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Gurpur is highly recognized in the field, and has recently been
        involved with the development of a specialized bone health supplement
        (bio-replenishment) called ‘OsteoDenx®, at en-N-tech / N-terminus
        Research Laboratories. OsteoDenx® is a safe and natural supplement made
        from milk proteins, Lactoferrin – a multi-functional protein with
        anti-inflammatory and immune-related functions, and Angiogenin – a
        ribonuclease which promotes the formation of new capillaries. This study
        evaluated the effect of OsteoDenx® and calcium supplementation on bone
        turnover markers in post-menopausal women. Elderly women are known to
        experience bone health issues due to reduced estrogen levels after
        menopause. Estrogen deficiency leads to elevated bone resorption rates
        and increased risk for fractures. Dr. Gurpur's outstanding research has
        many direct applications for the health of American people.</font>
</p>
<p>
  <font size="2" face="Arial">Available therapeutic options for this condition,
  such as hormone replacements therapy etc. are prone to serious side effects.
  Dr. Gurpur’s clinical study, for the first time, clearly demonstrated
  supplement-induced reduction in bone resorption as well as enhancement of bone
  formation, as measured by well-established serum bio-markers. A significant
  improvement of bone turnover was observed without any side effects, compared
  to a control group of women who received only calcium supplementation. This
  pioneering work on ribonuclease-enriched lactoferrin supplement is published
  in <i>Osteoporosis International,</i> the official journal of the
  International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and a highly cited journal that
  publishes topical and critical work in the field of endocrinology and
  metabolism (ranks at # 8 out of 93 journals in that field).<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Gurpur has continued his work on this clinical study and recently has
  shown that ribonuclease-enriched lactoferrin supplement improved the
  inflammatory status of the treated women compared to those of the calcium
  supplemented group. Based on a study of several inflammatory cytokines and
  markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP), he concluded that
  the immuno-modulating ability of lactoferrin accounts for this beneficial
  effect of the supplement. I understand that these noteworthy results will soon
  be published in <i>Inflammation Research</i>, an international, peer-reviewed
  journal of the European Histamine Research Society.<br>
  <br>
  In the US, population of the elderly (aged 50 years and above) is predicted to
  increase by 60% by 2035, compared to base year 2012. This will likely lead to
  an increasingly frail population at greater risk of falls and fracture. By 2035,
  osteoporotic fractures and treatment costs are projected to grow by 48%,
  rising to an estimated 3 million fractures that would incur upwards of $25
  billion in treatment costs. In this scenario, Dr. Gurpur’s excellent
  research and development of safe and natural bone health supplements
  represents a major step in the right direction. It is especially important due
  to the rising cost of healthcare and significant side effects of current
  hormone and related therapies. I do not have any reservations in recommending
  Dr. Praven Gurpur for permanent residency in the US, to continue his
  exceptional research on bio-replenishments for bone health which is in U.S.
  national interest.<br>

  Sincerely,<br>
  <br>
