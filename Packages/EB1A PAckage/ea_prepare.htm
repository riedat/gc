In the initial preparatory step, an

  <li>
    <p style="margin-top:11.25pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:

reference letters must meet certain requirements. They are not ordinary
recommendation letters for employment purpose. To successfully support an EB1-EA
petition, good reference letters are necessary. Some referrers may
want the applicant to provide a first draft for them to begin with. Generally,
three or more reference letters should be obtained. There is no requirement that
an applicant must have reference letters. But due to the importance of the reference
letters, it has become a recommended practice to obtain three or more of them.</font></p>

0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:110%"><font size="2" face="Arial">A good
reference letter should not simply praise the applicant to meet the requirements
of the EB1-EA petition, and such a practice will result in failing to support
crucial legal arguments. Drafting and
revising
reference letters have particular importance, because the contents
of the letters are a significant part of the foundation of an EB1-EA petition.&nbsp;</font></p>

totally left to an employer,
it may take long time for an employer to file a Labor Certification application and then
file a Form I-140 application (and later found that there are no <span style="color: black">immigration
visa numbers available in EB3 or EB2&nbsp; immigration categories</span>), when it could be done by yourself within several months without
