<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">RE: 1-140 form petition in the category of EB1-Extraordinary Ability
of Dr. Ming Zhou</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Sir or Madam:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is my great pleasure to write in support of Dr.
Zhou's petition for immigration to the United States, in the category of <i>EB1-Extraordinary Ability</i>.
Dr. Zhou currently holds a position of Research Associate in the Imaging Science and
Information Systems (ISIS) Center of the Radiology Department at Michigan University, and
he has been working under my direction as part of a research team on
a major early lung cancer detection project.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Zhou's research work is focused on developing a
clinically practical Computer Aided Cancer Diagnosis (CACD) system to help
radiologists in the detection and diagnosis of lung cancer during its early and
curable stage. I worked with Dr. Zhou during his doctoral research and served on his thesis review committee.
His research work is excellent and he has extraordinary ability in biomedical
research, and his research is important
to improve the
quality of health care in the United States.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lung cancer has become the most common and fatal
malignancy in the United States. It killed an estimated 199,400 Americans in
2009. During
the past ten years, the total number of annual lung cancer cases has climbed
steadily. The 1999 figure was 155,000. In 2009, approximately 199,900 new cases
were diagnosed, and it has increased more than any other major malignancy. Since
1997, more women have died of lung cancer than the breast cancer, which for over 40
years, was the major cause of cancer death in women. Because symptoms of lung
cancer often do not appear until the disease is in its advanced stage, an early
detection is difficult and very crucial to the cure of this deadly disease.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The early detection and diagnosis of lung nodules
in chest radiographs are among the most challenging clinical tasks performed by
radiologists. Previous studies showed that radiologists fail to diagnose small
lung nodules in as many as 30% of positive cases. In a 5-year screening project
at Johns Hopkins University Hospital for early detection of lung nodules, it has shown that
the missing rate can be decreased to less than 20% if two or more radiologists work
together. Thus, the development of a Computer Aided Cancer Diagnosis system
focuses on function as an &quot;alerting system&quot; that points out the potential
lung cancer locations, and as a &quot;second opinion&quot; provider that reports
the possibility of being a lung cancer for each potential cancer location.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Johns Hopkins's Early Lung Cancer Detection Project is a most important proof
of concept of the application of neural networks to early lung cancer detection
on chest radiographs. This project
consisted of approximately 10,000 prospectively enrolled high risk patients, who
were to be screened for the development of lung cancer with sputum cytology and lateral chest radiographs for 5 years, and were then to be followed
clinically for 14 years to assess long term outcomes.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Dr. Zhou's excellent research work represents a significant advance on previous work in
this field. Utilizing both digital image processing
techniques and artificial neural networks (ANN), the CACD system successively
perform two functions: 1) location of suspected nodule areas, also known as a
&quot;pre-scan process&quot;, on the digitized chest radiograph; and 2)
differentiation of &quot;true&quot; nodules from &quot;false&quot; nodules.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Dr. Zhou's successful research results have shown that the CACD
system can achieve an accuracy that may assist radiologists in detecting early
lung nodules.&nbsp;I was a participating radiologist in the Hopkins'
project. While working with that project, I realized that the Hopkins' collection of chest
radiographs would be of great value in testing Dr. Zhou's algorithm. Last year, Dr.
  Zhou started to inquire about the accessibility of the chest radiographs and
  the films from the Hopkins' project. In order to determine whether the films
  have adequate quality for our project, Dr. Zhou's reviewed a sample of the
  films, then he digitized 35 cancer cases and processed them with his developed algorithm.
In the original Hopkins' study, one radiologist detected an average of 68% of
those cancers that could be seen retrospectively. In Dr. Zhou's evaluation, this
  number was greatly improved.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The long term survival from lung cancer is
related to the size of the cancer at the time of detection. Dr. Zhou's excellent
research results demonstrate significant improvement in outcome of patients with early
lung cancers. A clinically implemented CACD system can serve
effectively as a second reader of chest radiographs, and assist radiologists in
the detection of early lung cancer. The clinical significance of Dr. Zhou's
project and excellent research work is that it will help radiologists in their case finding of small
and potentially curable patients with early stage lung cancer.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Zhou's research have been published in a
number of highly respected journals, such as <i>Journal of Cancer
Research </i> and <i> Biophysical Journal</i>, and he has also presented his
research work at several national and international conferences. Dr. Zhou's is also an active member of <i> American Association for Cancer
    Research</i> and <i> American Society for Biochemistry, </i>both are prestigious professional associations in the world.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Dr. Zhou has
shown his extraordinary ability in imaging science and
information application. Therefore, it is definitely necessary for
Dr. Zhou to remain in the U.S. and to continue his very successful research project.
I believe that this letter will serve to strengthen
Dr. Zhou's case and that his petition will be granted. If there are any
questions, please feel free to contact me.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sincerely,</font></p>
