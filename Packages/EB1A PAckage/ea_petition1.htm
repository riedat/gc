      Furthermore, I also discovered that transient removal of H2A-H2B dimers facilitates

  of Rochester, I demonstrated that the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), which

  &quot;Dr. Shetty made several important original contributions in characterizing effects of histone variants on chromatin dynamics. He discovered that the incorporation of histone variant called H2A.Bbd into a nucleosome alters the conformation of the nucleosome in a manner that facilitates the DNA transcription process. This study provided important evidence for the emerging theory that incorporation of a histone variant into a nucleosome is an alternative way to modulate chromatin structure in addition to histone modifications. This work was one of such great importance that it was quickly accepted for publication in the highly cited biomedical journal, EMBO Journal."
  Furthermore, Prof. Brian Garacci mentioned that &quot;Dr. Shetty and his colleagues found a novel role for Nucleosome Assembly Protein 1 (NAP-1) in mediating chromatin fluidity by incorporating histone variants and assisting nucleosome remodeling.

  Grey Carter wrote in his recommendation letter, &quot;Dr. Shetty is currently working on a project funded by NIH focusing on understanding how chromatin is modified to allow DNA repair to occur in an orderly fashion after DNA is damaged, and how changes in chromatin modification lead to human diseases, such as cancer. Taking advantage of his expertise in nucleosome and chromatin analysis techniques, and the powerful yeast genetics,
    Dr. Shetty is investigating whether INO80 plays a direct role in regulation of the kinase activity of ATM, which is the key signal transducer in DNA damage response. He has set up an elegant in vitro biochemical assay to monitor the stimulation of ATM kinase activity by chromatin
    remodelers.&quot; He also said that &quot;Dr. Shetty is virtually indispensable to the success of this research project, because of his unique skills and extraordinary abilities in chromatin research. We would lose an expert in the
    field and our research project would be adversely affected, if Dr. Shetty were unable to continue to participate our research.&quot;
