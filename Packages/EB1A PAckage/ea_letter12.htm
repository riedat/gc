        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services<br>
        <br>
        Dear Sir or Madam:<br>
        <br>
        I am pleased to write this letter in support of Dr. Praven Gurpur’s application for permanent residency in the United
        States, in the EB1-Extraordinary Ability category.<br>
        <br>
        I am currently the Associate Dean and Chief of Division of Cardiology, at the University of California – Irvine Medical Center. I received my cardiology training at the
        Boston University Medical Center. In 1999, I completed fellowships in heart failure and transplantation, nuclear cardiology and cardiology research at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and joined the Cardiology faculty at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Subsequently, I served as the Thomas J. Vischer Professor of Medicine, Chief of the Division of Cardiology, Vice-chairman of the Department of Internal Medicine, and Director of Heart Failure and Transplant Center at Hahnemann University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.<br>
        <br>
        I have received international recognition for my clinical and basic cardiology research. My major areas of research interest include identification of early signs of heart attack, management and reversal of heart failure. I have contributed significantly to the development of novel non-invasive imaging techniques and received several research grants from the National Institutes of Health. I have authored more than 300 research publications and over 25 books and monographs. I have been named “Best Young Investigator” on several occasions by the Cardiovascular Council, Society of Nuclear Medicine and the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology for my research contributions. I continue to serve on various committees of the American Heart Association, as an Associate Editor of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and Editor of the Heart Failure Clinics of North America.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Praven Gurpur is currently working as a Senior Research Scientist at en-N-tech / N-terminus Research Laboratory. Before joining en-N-tech, Dr. Gurpur has
        made valuable scientific contributions in protein biochemistry, drug development and nanotechnology, at the Beckman Research Institute at the City of Hope National Medical Center, Baylor University and Louisiana Tech University. He obtained PhD degree in physical chemistry from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in New Delhi, India. He has
        15 excellent publications in peer-reviewed, highly-cited journals and authored
        3 book chapters, and he obtained sustained national and international
        acclaim for his achievements in the field.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Gurpur is an outstanding researcher working on Liferol
        - a bioreplenishment for the management of blood cholesterol levels in individuals with a risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Based on safe and natural milk proteins and vitamin E (tocotrienols), Liferol lowers the low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the plasma. Compared to the current therapeutic treatment
        that block the cholesterol synthesis pathway early on and lead to remarkable side effects, Liferol only modulates the synthesis of cholesterol at a later stage in the physiological pathway. A clinical research study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Liferol is underway by en-N-tech / N-terminus Research Laboratory.<br>
        <br>
        According to the American Heart Association, an estimated 80 million American adults (1 in 3) have at least one of the types of CVD. About 52% (42.5 million) of these individuals are below 60 years of age. CVD is the major cause of death also among women. Given that millions of Americans are affected by CVD, Dr. Gurpur’s
        research and development of natural bio-replenishments has significant impact on improving cardiovascular
        health, and he has made significant contributions to the field. With the rising cost of healthcare, clinical management of cardio-vascular health using effective natural bio-replenishments could reduce economic burden and improve quality of life. I fully support his application and recommend that Dr. Gurpur be granted permanent residency in the United States.</font></p>
