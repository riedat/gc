Purpose of Form I-907 - Request for Premium Processing Service<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
For employers may use Form I-907 to request faster processing of certain employment-based petitions and applications, such as the Form
I-140, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. Premium Processing Service provides faster processing of certain employment-based petitions and applications. Specifically, USCIS provides 15 calendar day processing to those who choose to use this service, or USCIS will refund the Premium Processing fee and the relating case will continue to receive faster processing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The processing period that is used to determine whether or not USCIS meets the 15 calendar day period will begin when the current version of Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service, is received by USCIS at the correct filing address noted on the form. Within the 15 day calendar period USCIS will issue an approval notice, or where appropriate, a notice of intent to deny, a request for evidence or open an investigation for fraud or misrepresentation. If the notice requires the submission of additional evidence or of a response to intent to deny, a new 15 calendar day period will begin upon the delivery to USCIS of a complete response to the request for evidence or notice of intent to deny.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Petitioners may use the
USCIS Form I-907 to request faster
processing of certain employment-based petitions. </span>This request may be filed with
the relating application, or it may be filed after, as long as the relating application is still pending.</font></p>

Where to and How to File Form I-907</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">You must complete and sign Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service, in accordance with the instructions on the current version of the form. You must file the concurrently filed Form I-907 with Form
I-140 at the USCIS Service Center designated as the appropriate filing location on the instructions to the Form I-907.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you filed Form I-140 you now wish to request Premium Processing Service, file Form I-907 with the Service Center where the Form
I-140 is currently pending. Submit a copy of the Form I-140 filing receipt.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you received a transfer notice, it is very important that you include a copy of it and that you submit your filing to the transfer location. If a petitioner or applicant erroneously filed a concurrent or standalone Form I-907 at the wrong service center, USCIS will not reject the filing, but instead will forward the filing to the correct service center having jurisdiction over the petition or application.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
For an incorrectly filed Form I-907, the 15 calendar day period will start on the date the file is received at the correct service center as indicated in the Form I-907 filing instructions.
The filing location for Form I-907 depends on whether you are requesting Premium Processing Service for Form
I-140. You may be eligible to file this form electronically. When E-Filing Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service, by itself or concurrently with any Form
I-140, please send the associated Supporting Documentation as a single package to the same USCIS processing location identified on the “Instruction for I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service”</font></p>
