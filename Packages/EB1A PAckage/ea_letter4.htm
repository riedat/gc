<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">RE: 1-140 Petition of EB1 Extraordinary Ability for Dr. Ming Zhou</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear USCIS officer:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I am writing this letter to support Dr. Zhou's
petition for immigration to United States in the EB1-Extraordinary Ability
category. Specifically, I am writing to
provide evidence that Dr. Zhou has extraordinary ability in cancer research and&nbsp; has done an
excellent research work.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As a professor and director of Imaging Science
and Information Systems (ISIS) Center at Michigan University, I know Dr. Zhou
and his research accomplishment personally. Dr. Zhou is
currently a Research Associate at the ISIS Center of
Michigan
University. He has designed various computer-aided
diagnosis schemes for early detection and classification of cancerous lung
nodules, and published his research results in several prestigious academic
journals, including <i>Journal of Cancer Research</i> and <i>Biophysical Journal</i>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lung cancer is one of the most common and deadly
diseases in the world. The cure of lung cancer depends highly on the early
detection and treatment of small and localized tumors. However, early detection
of cancerous lung nodules in chest radiographs has been a clinically difficult
and challenging task. Although experienced lung
radiologists can achieve a degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of chest
nodules, still the performance of using direct inspection is limited by the
subjective decision criteria used by different radiologists, a time consuming
detection cycle, and high miss rate of small and low contrast nodules surrounded
by noisy anatomic lung background. Among the researches of improving the
diagnostic accuracy, the Computer Assisted Cancer Diagnosis (CACD) has been
concluded as a promising approach.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A prototype of
computer-aided system has recently been implemented with Dr. Zhou's outstanding
research work and primary efforts. We
are in the stage of evaluating the system in a clinical setting. This system
will be used to assist the chest radiologist in detecting lung cancer.&nbsp;Last
year, Dr. Zhou received an <i> American Cancer
Society Research Award</i>, which is an prominent award in the filed, and it
will encourage him to continue working on
advanced intelligent systems to assist radiologists in early detection of lung
and breast cancers. Dr. Zhou's excellent research has been reported in several
international conferences, and is highly commented by both academic experts and industrial
leaders.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Zhou 's
innovative research, using artificial neural networks to detect lung nodules,
has great potential in clinical application. He has been working on the
development and application of CACD system in digital chest radiography to
enhance the detection of small or potential cancerous nodules. Dr. Zhou has unique
expertise in numerous complex techniques, including artificial neural networks,
genetic algorithms, and fuzzy logic.&nbsp;Application of these techniques and understanding
of clinical aspects of lung cancer permit him to develop an intelligent medical
diagnostic imaging system. Furthermore, his research may have broader
implications in other medical or difficult diagnosis tasks, such as the early
detection of breast cancer in mammography.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Zhou has been one of the top pioneers in the
field, in using the neural networks for lung nodule
detection. He has dedicated his research career in making the use of the
neural networks in lung cancer detection clinically.&nbsp;Dr. Zhou is
currently conducting an important project of using CACD for detecting lung
cancer based on a large proven cancer database. The database, which is in our
possession, consists of the complete medical records and chest x-ray images of
10,000 lung cancer cases, collected over the past 20 years by Johns Hopkins
University Medical Center. Dr. Zhou will use this database to test the medical
diagnostic imaging system that he has been developing. The success of this project will
potentially increase radiologists' diagnostic accuracy and reduce the health care
cost in the United States.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Zhou has extraordinary ability in lung cancer
research, and he is currently in a unique position to assist radiologists in the
early detection of lung cancer. I believe that Dr. Zhou will be very
productive in his research efforts, and I fully support and recommend that his
immigration petition in EB1-Extraordinary Ability category be granted.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sincerely,</font></p>
