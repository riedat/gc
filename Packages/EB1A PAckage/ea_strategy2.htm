<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">1. Useful Tips for an Effective EB1-Extraordinary Ability Petition</font></b>
    </p>

      <blockquote>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Reference letters and Testimony from Independent Experts</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial">:
When collecting evidence, reference letters
(or support letters) submitted by other experts in the field should be carefully screened for statement
and implication. The letters should clearly support the specific claimed criterion. The petitioner should work with people writing support letters, review the letters before they are finalized, and ask the writers to revise the letters if necessary.</font>
    </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The USCIS examiner's determination relied heavily on the testimony of witnesses with varying degrees of connection to the applicant. The letters of support from the expert witnesses who has indirect connection with applicant are considered favorably, and the letters of support need to prove that the impact of the applicant’s work stretched well beyond the circle of colleagues who had worked with the alien directly.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The testimony from independent established experts who knew the applicant mostly from his or her published work may demonstrate that the applicant has significant national or international
attention.</font>
    </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>2) Published
    material about the petitioner:
    </b>Some petitioners' presented articles only mention the petitioner’s name or
    work as evidence of &quot;the alien's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional
  or major trade publications or other major media.&quot; However, the
    USCIS has repeatedly stated that such citations do not satisfy this requirement.&nbsp;</font>
    </p>

    <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">3) The artist showcase criteria are
    not for a scientist: </font>
    </b> <font size="2" face="Arial"> As the USCIS has repeated, not all of the criteria are appropriate or apply to
    every petitioner. One frequent misapplication of a criterion is an applicant’s assertion of
    his/her work being displayed in artist showcases, when in fact the petitioner is seeking classification as a scientist or an athlete.</font>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">4) Quote the regulations directly to spell out the law:
    </font>
    </b>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">
    To help ensure that your case
    will not be wrongfully denied by inexperienced
    USCIS examiners, when writing the petition cover letter and/or reference letters,
    you should quote the regulations directly to spell out the law for a potentially less-than-informed
    adjudicator. That way the examiner should not be confused about language or
    requirements, and it will lead to accurate adjudications for the first try.</font>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">5) The regulations for EB1-EA require only three criteria
    to be filled: </font>
 </b> <font size="2" face="Arial"> As long as those three criteria are well substantiated with primary evidence and strong
    support, the absence of
    other criteria should not be the cause for a denial.</font>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">6) The requirement of establishing national or international
    acclaim: </font>
 </b> <font size="2" face="Arial"> There is confusion among
    USCIS adjudicators regarding the requirement of establishing national or international
    acclaim. The
    regulation demands "national or international" acclaim, and the
    USCIS has no discretion to rule that simply having national, not international,
    acclaim in a given field is insufficient to establish extraordinary ability. However, in several
    cases, the
    USCIS service centers wrongfully denied the petition because the individual failed to establish international
    acclaim.&nbsp;</font>
<p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">7)
    It is important to determine the appropriate time to petition for
    EB1-EA classification:</font></b> <font size="2" face="Arial"> The
    USCIS may reject post-filing submissions of evidence. Petitioners must possess the necessary qualifications at the time of the original
    (or initial) petition. In some cases, if a petitioner can wait until after his/her important article published, his/her case
may be stronger.</font>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">8)
    For the field of
    endeavor:</font></b> <font size="2" face="Arial"> It is
    important to strategically think about and identify the field of endeavor in which the petitioner is seeking extraordinary ability classification. Although the rule
    is to have the narrowest field possible (i.e. high energy elementary matter physicist vs. physicist), the
    USCIS might reject such a narrow categorization, and dismiss any evidence submitted in support of extraordinary ability outside the narrow category.&nbsp;</font>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">9)
    The young
    applicants with short career: </font> </b> <font size="2" face="Arial"> The age of the applicant is not mentioned at
    all in the federal regulations governing EB1-Extraordinary
    Ability application.
    However, some examiners at the USCIS have shown that they feel that age is a significant factor in determining eligibility.
    We all know that the age is not an indicator of ability, but a young applicant who wishes to apply for an extraordinary ability
    Green Card must be able to show that
    he or she has been very productive over his or her
    short career.</font>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">10) Avoid statements
    that there is a shortage of U.S. workers in your field: </font>
    </b> <font size="2" face="Arial"> An area to avoid
    involves statements that there is a shortage of U.S. workers in your field.
    This will result in the USCIS examiner saying that you should definitely go
    through the Labor Certification process, not the EB1-EA application.</font>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">11) The personality or
    hard-working nature of the beneficiary: </font>
    </b> <font size="2" face="Arial"> The reference letter writers frequently find it
    is necessary to comment upon the personality or hard-working nature of the
    beneficiary. While such comments would be appropriate in other contexts,
    they are not relevant to the issue of the alien's extraordinary ability. The
    alien's competency and expertise, as well as the significance of his/her
    work, should be evaluated by reference to objective facts to the fullest
    extent possible.</font>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. How to
Determine Whether an Alien Applicant Has “Sustained&quot; National or
International Acclaim?</font></b>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For EB1
Extraordinary Ability immigrant application, it must be accompanied by evidence
that the alien applicant has sustained national or international acclaim, and
the alien applicant's achievements have been recognized in the field of
expertise.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For USCIS to
determine whether an alien applicant has enjoyed “sustained&quot; national or
international acclaim, such acclaim must be maintained for over a long period of
time. But the word “sustained” does not imply an age limit on the alien
applicant. An alien could be young in his/her career and still may show
sustained national or international acclaim.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Also, there is no
time frame for the word of “sustained.” If an alien applicant was recognized
for an achievement, the USCIS officer will determine whether or not the alien
applicant continues to maintain the acclaim level in the field. It is possible
that an alien applicant has achieved the national or international acclaim
previously, but failed to maintain the acclaim level thereafter.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) If you are able
  to show that you meet at least 3 of the above regulatory criteria, USCIS will
  then review all of the evidence in the record in its totality to determine if
  it is more likely than not that you have sustained national or international
  acclaim and are one of that small percentage who has risen to the very top of
  the field of endeavor. As such, it is important to show, for example, the
  significance of the work of others you judged, the significance and importance
  of the scholarly works you created, and the degree to which the salary or
  other remuneration you commanded was higher than others in your field.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Certain
  qualitative factors have been included in the determination. The stronger the
  evidence is in terms of your achievements in the field compared to others, the
  more efficiently and accurately USCIS can process your petition.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#006666" size="2">3. The USCIS'
Evaluation of Submitted Evidence in Support of a Petition for an Alien of
Extraordinary Ability<br>
</font></b><font size="2"><br>
The submitted evidence should demonstrate that the alien
applicant has sustained national or international acclaim, and the alien
applicant’s achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise. The
evidence should include documents of a one-time achievement (a major
international recognized award), or at least three of the ten types of evidence
list above. The submitted documents should establish that the alien applicant
can meet the requirements as an alien of extraordinary ability.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
For a Form I-140 application as an alien of extraordinary ability, USCIS
adjudicators will look at the quality not the quantity of the evidence. The
USCIS adjudicators will evaluate the submitted evidence to determine if the
alien applicant has demonstrated that he or she has received sustained national
or international acclaim in the field of endeavor.<br>
<br>
USCIS will evaluate the quality of submitted evidence on a case-by-case basis,
to determine whether the evidence submitted satisfies the qualification
requirements to establish the eligibility for EB-1A immigration visa. If
the ten criteria for EB-1A do not apply, the alien applicants can also submit
comparable evidence to establish the EB-1A eligibility. When the comparable
evidence is submitted, USCIS may require the petitioner to explain why the ten
criteria for EB-1A do not apply.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The USCIS'
adjudication guideline also include:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The evidence
    submitted to USCIS in supporting the EB-1A application does not need to use
    the words &quot;extraordinary ability&quot; specifically. Rather, the
    supporting documents should be apparent that the alien applicant's
    contributions to a field are qualifying the extraordinary ability
    requirements.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In some cases,
    the submission of voluminous documents may not contain sufficient evidence
    to establish the applicant’s eligibility for EB-1A qualification. For all
    cases, the evidence submitted for an EB1 Extraordinary Ability application
    must establish that the alien beneficiary &quot;is one of that small
    percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor.&quot;&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">An alien
    applicant may be stronger in one particular area than in others, but the
    overall impression should be that the alien applicant is of extraordinary
    ability. The USCIS adjudicators should not predetermine the evidence they
    think the alien applicant should submit, and deny the EB-1A application if
    that particular type of evidence is not there.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In a regular
    case, if an alien applicant is extraordinary, there should be published
    articles about the alien applicant's work. But an USCIS adjudicator will not
    deny the EB-1A application, because no published articles were submitted, if
    evidence of meeting 3 EB-1A criteria has been submitted that demonstrates
    the alien applicant is in fact extraordinary.&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">If an USCIS
    adjudicator needs to request additional evidence, the adjudicator may
    provide explanation of the deficiencies in the submitted evidence, or may
    request for evidence that the petitioner could provide to corroborate the
    statements made in the original petition documents.&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
