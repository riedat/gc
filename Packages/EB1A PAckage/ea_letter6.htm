  EB1-Extraordinary Ability for <span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none"> Dr.
  Allan </span> Wang</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Officer:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is my pleasure to write this letter in support
of Dr. <span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">Allan </span> Wang’s petition for the
EB1-Extraordinary Ability
(I-140 Form) to obtain
permanent resident status in the United States, and also providing the
explanations that his current research and development in the interest of United
States and his outstanding achievement.</font></p>
<p class="SP" align="left" style="text-align:left;text-indent:0in"><font size="2" face="Arial">I
have known Dr. Wang since March 2008, when he joined our Semiconductor
Development Laboratory of Advanced Materials at Charlotte, North
Carolina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As Dr. Wang’ supervisor, I
am a Senior Scientist and the director of the Laboratory, and an expert specializing in
semiconductor, optics, and photochemistry of metal. I am also the 2008 winner of
the Edwin D. Smith medal of the Physics Society of America.</font></p>
<p class="SP" align="left" style="text-align:left;text-indent:0in"><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr.
Wang received his PhD from Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Science in
July 2006. Thereafter, he was awarded &quot;Alexander von Humboldt<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Research Fellowship&quot; which is for highly qualified scholars and
scientists of all nationalities not resident in Germany, enabling them to
undertake periods of research in Germany.</font></p>
<p class="SP" align="left" style="text-align:left;text-indent:0in"><font size="2" face="Arial">As
a visiting researcher in our Laboratory, Dr. Wang’s research interests are in
surface physics, photochemistry of metal, and semiconductor materials, which
include characterization of metal; semiconductor nanoparticles; electron
transfer reactions; heterogeneous catalysis; environmental treatment by photo
catalysis, and nonlinear optical spectroscopy. Dr.
Wang have been working on several research projects funded by Department of
Energy and National Science Foundation. At the same time, he also has been
working with Prof. Kevin Bruno at Department of Material, University of
Pennsylvania, for
an advanced composite material research project, funded by U.S. Air Force.</font></p>
<p class="SP" align="left" style="text-align:left;text-indent:0in"><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr.
Wang’s current area of research is the photochemistry of metal and its
application in semiconductor materials, Dr. Wang is also the inventor of the new
instruments for electron transfer reactions measurement and many other high
technology instruments in current use in our laboratory, on which other
scientist’s new research is based.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>After
joining the Advanced Materials, Dr. Wang has published more than ten papers in
major academic journals, two book chapters on semiconductor materials and
nonlinear optical spectroscopy, one issued patent and two more pending. Also,
Dr. Wang have taught at the University level and worked in industry before, and
now bridge the academic and industrial worlds with collaborations through
research projects.</font></p>
<p class="SP" align="left" style="text-align:left;text-indent:0in"><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr.
Wang’s excellent skills in semiconductor, optics, and instrumentation are
strongly needed in our research projects at Advanced Materials. He always wants
to develop new technology and the other side of the field. As a group leader in
several research projects, he is very good at researching new fields and
developing innovative methods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I am
a hands-off supervisor, so Dr. Wang has managed the projects almost entirely on
his own. Last month, he had one paper accepted by <i> Nonlinear Optical
Technology</i>, and another will appear later this year in <i> Journal of International Electrical
Engineering.</i> </font></p>
<p class="SP" align="left" style="text-align:left;text-indent:0in"><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr.
Wang’ demonstrated his extraordinary ability in the research projects, such as
“A Pulsed Laser Proteolysis Study” and “Photonic Efficiency and Quantum
Yield of Formaldehyde Formation”, both supported by Department of Energy and
National Science Foundation. Dr. Wang’s achievements play a critical role in
these projects and research programs. Examples of the Dr. Wang’s contributions
to the current research project include his publications,
patents, and breakthrough achievements in his research results.</font></p>
<p class="SP" align="left" style="text-align:left;text-indent:0in"><font size="2" face="Arial">As
a director in the Semiconductor Development Laboratory and Dr. Wang’s
supervisor, I do feel responsibility that the United States needs to keep its
technology development in the global competition, and we should not lose
excellent researcher like Dr. Wang.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The same is true for the efforts we have invested here at
Advanced Materials. I really believe that Dr. Wang will continue bring his
excellent skill to further success of our research projects, if he could get I-140 Immigrant Petition
approval based on his excellent research ability.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p class="SP" align="left" style="text-align:left;text-indent:0in"><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr.
Wang’s leading and critical role is important and significant to our projects
here at Advanced Materials. His research work is also important to U.S. industry and to U.S.
homeland security. His combination of skills and ability in semiconductor,
optics, and instrumentation are extremely hard to match.</font></p>
  <p class="SP" align="left" style="text-align:left;text-indent:0in"><span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> Dr.
  Allan </font> </span> <font face="Arial" size="2"> Wang is an accomplished researcher
  and I hope we can keep Dr. Wang's
talent and expertise. Therefore, I ask the USCIS to review Dr. Wang's
  important
scientific contributions and his extraordinary research ability.&nbsp;</font></p>
