<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">1. The Most Important Aspects
of EB1-Extraordinary Ability Petition&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The employment based immigration is one of the most popular ways to obtain U.S.
permanent residency. The EB-1 permanent residency process is a two-application process. One application
is called the Form I-140 petition, which is filed for an immigrant visa and it can be filed by a U.S. employer, or
it can be self-petitioned
by an alien in the case of EB1-Extraordinary Ability (or EB1-EA, EB1A). The other application
should be filed by an alien, and is called the Form I-485 petition to change his or her status to
a permanent resident of United States.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> The most important aspects of EB1-Extraordinary Ability
petition include:</font></p>

    <blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) The EB1-Extraordinary Ability is for aliens of extraordinary ability in
sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, which has been demonstrated
by sustained national or international acclaim, and who will prospectively be of substantial benefit to the United States. No job offer
and Labor Certification are required for this immigration category. An alien may file
a self-petition of Form I-140 without his/her employer's sponsorship and help,
or an employer may file the Form I-140 petition for an employee.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Many accomplished foreign nationals have successfully obtained
their Green Cards in the EB1-Extraordinary Ability
category. However, the standards are rigorous.
If you meet the qualification requirements, you will be able to avoid going through
a Labor Certification process or even not need to have a job offer, and you will be able to apply
for your Green Cad without the sponsorship of an employer.
For those who have outstanding achievements in an academic field, applying for Green Card in the EB1-Extraordinary Ability category may be
their best choice.&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">3) One way to determine whether an alien should
    seek a Green
Card as an extraordinary individual is he or she should be in &quot;<i>one of the small percentage who has risen to the very
    top in a field</i>&quot;. For scientists and researchers, publishing papers and articles is a common product of their research. If a scientist applying
    for as an extraordinary individual can show that the publications have appeared in the
prestigious scientific journals, this will help establish the scientist as an extraordinary applicant. Furthermore, if this scientist's work is commonly referred to and cited by other articles, or if he or she is frequently asked to sit on panels and review other people’s work, these
evidence will help demonstrate the qualifications as an extraordinary alien.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">4) The important issue to keep in mind when applying for the extraordinary ability category is
    the uniqueness. An applicant has to show that he or she is not the normal average individual in the field. Although it may take years of studying and training to be able to just participate in a field, that is not enough. The applicant has to show that he or she truly stands out among the crowd in knowledge, skills, and talent.<br>
<br>
    5) The artists or athletes can also demonstrate the extraordinary ability by comparing himself/herself to others. For example, a soccer player can show that he has longer playing time compared to the average soccer
players in a famous league. He can show that he gets paid more than the typical
    players. Inclusion of his statistics and those of the league average will help to show that he is a special player. Winning awards like
    &quot;<i>Most Valuable Player</i>&quot; in a country also reflect his uniqueness as a player.</font></p>

<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. The Qualification
Requirements for EB1-Extraordinary Ability Petitions</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Extraordinary Ability is defined as
&quot;<i>a level of expertise indicating that the individual is one of a small
percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor.</i>&quot; The
law requires extensive documentation to establish eligibility.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The basic requirement for EB1
Extraordinary Ability application is that you must be able to establish that you
have extraordinary ability in your field. The EB-1 extraordinary ability
immigrant visa is for alien applicants who are recognized as being at the very
top of a field, and who are coming to U.S. to continue their work in the field.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To establish the eligibility EB-1
extraordinary ability application, the petitioner must demonstrate sustained
national or international acclaim, and that the alien applicant's achievements
have been recognized in the field by showing:&nbsp;</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">a) Received a one-time major
  internationally recognized award (such as Nobel Prize); or&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">b) Meet at least three of the
  ten requirements below, and the evidence shows that you are among the small
  percentage of individuals that have risen to the very top of the field:</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font FACE="Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2"> To qualify as an
Alien of Extraordinary Ability, the alien must be able to provide evidence of a
one-time achievement that is a major international recognized award, or at
least three of the following:</font></p>

<blockquote>
</font>
<font size="2" face="Arial">1) Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser
  nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in
  the field of endeavor;
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Documentation of the alien's membership in
  associations in the field for which classification is sought, which require
  outstanding achievements of their members, as judged by recognized national or
  international experts in their disciplines or fields;
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">3) Published material about the alien in
  professional or major trade publications or other major media, relating to the
  alien's work in the field for which classification is sought. Such evidence
  shall include the title, date, and author of the material, and any necessary
  translation;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">4) Evidence of the alien's participation, either
  individually or on a panel, as a judge of the work of others in the same or an
  allied field of specification for which classification is sought;
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">5) Evidence of the alien's original scientific,
  scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions of major
  significance in the field;
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">6) Evidence of the alien's authorship of scholarly
  articles in the field, in professional or major trade publications or other
  major media;
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">7) Evidence of the display of the alien's work in
  the field at artistic exhibitions or showcases;
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">8) Evidence that the alien has performed in a
  leading or critical role for organizations or establishments that have a
  distinguished reputation;
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">9) Evidence that the alien has commanded a high
  salary or other significantly high remuneration for services, in relation to
  others in the field; or
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">10) Evidence of commercial successes in the
  performing arts, as shown by box office receipts or record, cassette, compact
  disk, or video sales.</font>
    </blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">If above criteria do
not apply to your situation, you can also submit &quot;comparable evidence&quot;
to establish your eligibility for EB1 extraordinary ability. But there is no comparable evidence for the one-time achievement of a major, international
recognized award.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">3. The EB1
Extraordinary Ability Application Requirement - Continue to Work in Your Area
of Extraordinary Ability&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Another requirement for EB1 Extraordinary Ability application is that you must be able
to establish that you are coming to the United States to continue to work in
your area of extraordinary ability. Some of the evidence you may submit to
demonstrate that you are coming to the United States to continue to work in your
area of extraordinary ability includes:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Letters from
    current or prospective employers;</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Documents
    evidencing your prearranged commitments (such as contracts);</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">A statement
    detailing your plans on how you intend to continue working in your field in
    the United States.</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#006666"><b>4.
What is the &quot;Sustained&quot; National or International Acclaim for EB1
Extraordinary Ability<br>
</b></font><font color="#800000"><br>
</font>
An application for an EB1 extraordinary ability must submit evidence that the
alien applicant has &quot;sustained&quot; national or international acclaim, and
that the alien applicant's achievements have been recognized in the field.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
An alien applicant may have achieved extraordinary ability before, but failed to
maintain the level of acclaim thereafter. For USCIS to determine whether the
beneficiary has the “sustained&quot; national or international acclaim, such
sustained acclaim must be continuing without termination or interruption. If an
alien applicant was recognized for achievement several years ago, USCIS
adjudicators will decide whether the alien applicant has maintained an acclaim
level.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">On the other hand, a
one-time major achievement such as a Nobel Prize, may satisfy this requirement,
if the alien has reached the summit of his or her occupation. However, without
such a major and international recognized award, the petitioner cannot rely on
the alien beneficiary's past achievements to establish the alien's eligibility
for EB1 extraordinary ability. The EB-1A regulations also allow the petitioner
to submit evidence that the alien applicant has the sustained national and
international acclaimed by submitting evidence of at least three of the ten
EB-1A criteria.</font></p>
