    <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial" color="#006666" size="2">1. Understand
    the Employment-Based First Preference Immigration to Determine Your Petition
    Options&nbsp; </font></b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A First Preference Immigration (EB-1) is an employment-based petition for
U.S. permanent residence reserved for those who are among the most able and accomplished in their respective fields within the arts, sciences, education, business, or sports. There are three
types of EB-1 petitions:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Alien of Extraordinary Ability EB-1A:</font></b>
  <font size="2" face="Arial">
 Persons of Extraordinary Ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics have sustained national or international acclaim that should be demonstrated through extensive documentation. Such individuals should continue to work in the same field, and
  the admission as permanent residents should substantially benefit the U.S.</font></p>

  <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Outstanding Researcher/Outstanding Professor
  EB-1B:</font></b> <font size="2" face="Arial"> Outstanding Researchers or Outstanding
  Professors
  must be internationally recognized in particular academic areas and possess at least 3 years of academic research or teaching experience. They must have tenured or tenure-track positions at universities or institutes of higher education, or in comparable research positions in
  private companies that employ at least three full-time researchers. Such institutions
  or companies must also demonstrate documented accomplishments in the field.</font></p>

  <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">3)
 Multinational Managers and Executive Transferees EB-1C:</font></b>
  <font size="2" face="Arial">
 Multinational Executives or Managers require individuals to be employed abroad in the same capacity during at least one of the three years preceding their applications for admission to
  U.S. as priority workers. Such individuals must enter the U.S. to be employed as executives or managers for the same firm, corporation, or legal entity, or for a subsidiary or affiliate of the entity that employed them abroad.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The most notable advantage for those who qualify for an EB-1 petition is the lack of a Labor Certification requirement. Obtaining a Labor Certification
can be a time-consuming and expensive process that seeks to determine whether a qualified U.S. worker is available to fill the position sought by the petitioning alien. In addition to the time and expense of the Labor Certification process, an alien risks being denied a Labor Certification if a U.S. worker with technical qualifications for the employment is found, even if the alien is actually more suitable for the position based on factors not considered in the Labor Certification process. Often, the immigration
visa numbers in the EB-3 or EB-2 categories are not available or not "current", after aliens obtain their Labor Certification.<br>
<br>
However, in an EB-1 petition, the Labor Certification is not required at all.
Also for EB-1A petition, a permanent job offer is not required, and an alien may petition immigration by himself or
herself without a U.S. employer's sponsorship.
But in
EB-1B and EB-1C petitions, a permanent job offer is required, and a U.S. employer must be the petitioner
for the EB-1B or EB-1C petition.</font></p>

<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. The Differences between
the Immigration Categories of &quot;Alien of Extraordinary Ability&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Researcher or Professor&quot;<br>
</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
Although both EB-1A and EB-1B categories are first immigration preference for
U.S. permanent residency and they have similarities, there are several key
differences.&nbsp;</font>
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) The similarities include:&nbsp;</font>
</p>

  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Neither requires a Labor Certification;&nbsp;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Both categories require extensive evidence of achievement and
      excellent ability;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Supporting documentation for each petition is
      similar.&nbsp;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2) The differences include:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The "Extraordinary Ability" category generally requires
      higher achievement and ability;&nbsp;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The "Extraordinary Ability'' category can apply to many different
      fields in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, while the "Outstanding
      Researcher or Professor&quot; category generally applies to scientific or scholarly fields;&nbsp;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The "Extraordinary Ability" category requires no specific employment or job offer, while the
      &quot;Outstanding Researcher or Professor&quot; category requires a job offer for a permanent research
      position or a tenured/tenure track teaching position;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">One can self-petition in the "Extraordinary Ability&quot;
      category without a U.S. employer's sponsorship, while the &quot;Outstanding Researcher or Professor&quot; category requires a sponsorship from the alien's employer or prospective employer;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The &quot;Outstanding Researcher or Professor&quot; category requires at least three years experience in the field, while the "Extraordinary Ability" category has no specified minimum experience requirement for any particular field.&nbsp;</font></li>
  </ul>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">3.
    Could You Qualify for an EB-1 Extraordinary Ability Immigrant Visa?</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Answer three questions below to see if you could qualify for an EB-1 Extraordinary Ability
immigrant visa:</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Do you have extraordinary ability in business, science, arts, education or athletics?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Do you have sustained national or international acclaim in your field?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">3) Are you coming to the United States to work in your area of extraordinary ability?</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you answered Yes to all of the questions above, you may meet the requirements for an EB-1 Extraordinary Ability Visa.
A worker with extraordinary ability in the sciences,
<font color="#333333"> arts, education, business, or athletics, may qualify for a
    Green Card as a priority worker. The achievements must have been publicly recognized, and resulted in a period of sustained national or international acclaim. This often involves showing that the foreign national is a widely acknowledged leader in the particular artistic, educational, business, or athletic field.<br>
    <br>
    No job offer is needed in this subcategory so long as the foreign national will continue working in the field of expertise after arriving in the United States. If, however, the worker has received a job offer from a U.S. employer, that employer can help with the EB-1 application by filing the required initial
    application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on Form I-140.</font></font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">An Form I-140 application filed for an alien immigrant with extraordinary ability must demonstrate that the alien applicant has a level of expertise
    that the alien has risen to the top of the field. Evidence must be submitted to support an Form I-140 application for an alien of extraordinary ability. An EB1 Extraordinary Ability
    application must be accompanied by initial evidence:</font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">a) the alien applicant has sustained national or international acclaim; and&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">b) the alien applicant’s achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">4. The EB1 Extraordinary
Ability Application for O-1 Visa Holders</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In some cases, an EB-1A petition may be filed on behalf of an alien who was previously granted the O-1 visa, alien of extraordinary ability nonimmigrant
visa. Though the prior approval of an O-1 visa petition on behalf of the alien may be a relevant consideration in adjudicating the EB-1A petition, USCIS
is not bound by the fact that the alien was previously accorded the O-1 visa if the facts do not support approval of the E11 petition; eligibility as an
O-1 visa does not automatically establish eligibility under the EB-1A criteria for extraordinary ability.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Each petition is separate and independent, and must be adjudicated on its own merits, under the corresponding statutory and regulatory provisions.
Moreover, the O-1 nonimmigrant visa includes different standards and criteria for aliens in the arts, athletics, and the motion picture industry. In
such cases, there would be nothing inconsistent about finding that an alien in the arts has “distinction” according to the O-1
nonimmigrant visa
criteria, but not “national or international acclaim” according to the EB-1A immigrant criteria.<br>
<br>
USCIS believe each petition must be adjudicated on its own merits. Previously, some courts have asked USCIS to provide an explanation as to why the
alien is not eligible for EB-1A employment-based immigrant visa, if the alien had previously been approved in an O-1 nonimmigrant visa.
Therefore, the alien applicant need to meet its burden to establish eligibility for approval of the EB-1A I-140 petition.</font></p>
