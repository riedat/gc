<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">1. File an EB1-EA Petition as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow&nbsp;</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
<br>
Dr. Demidov contacted our Service shortly after he heard a successful story from one of his friend by using our Completely
Do-It-Yourself EB1-EA package. He was also interested in applying for a Green Card under the category of EB1-EA - Aliens
with Extraordinary Ability, and he wondered whether he was qualified.<br>
<br>
Dr. Demidov received master and doctoral degrees in physics and engineering disciplines. When he emailed our Service, he
was a postdoctoral research fellow at a top U.S. university. During his graduate and post-graduate studies, he had
produced some original findings in a cutting-edge area of electrical engineering with commercial and military
applications. Although Dr. Demidov had only six journal publications, they were being steadily cited by other researchers
in his field. Dr. Demidov also had three conference presentations and one patent, as well as limited experience as a peer
reviewer.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We responded to Dr. Demidov’s email for his question and concerns about the EB1-EA application, and told Dr. Demidov that
his EB1-EA application could be successful if he could get several strong letters of recommendation. Dr. Demidov agreed
and purchased the Complete Do-It-Yourself package of EB1-EA petition from us, and he soon started to prepare his case.<br>
<br>
Thereafter, Dr. Demidov and his recommenders worked together to prepare his recommendation letters, by following the
sample reference letters in our EB1-EA package. He made sure that the letters should closely address the requirements for EB1-EA petitions. In particular, the
recommendation letters should describe the significance of his research achievements, which would not be immediately
apparent to the USCIS adjudicator reviewing his case, since he was working on a cutting-edge area of electrical
engineering.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Once the recommendation letters were done, Dr. Demidov worked to compile the rest of his supporting evidence, and drafted
his petition cover letter by following the style and format of the sample cover letter in the EB1-EA package. In the
petition cover letter, Dr. Demidov demonstrated his extraordinary abilities through his publications in prestigious
journals, his presentations in distinguished conferences, his work as a reviewer in his field, and his merit-based
membership in professional associations.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
After reviewing his petition cover letter, we provided our effective petition strategies and professional suggestions.
Afterward, Dr. Demidov modified his petition cover letter based on our suggestions, and filed his EB1-EA petition using
USCIS’ Premium Processing Service, to take advantage of the USCIS' quick adjudication within 15 days.&nbsp;</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. Prepare the RFE Response with the Help of our RFE package of EB1-EA Petition&nbsp;<br>
</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
After 21 days of waiting, Dr. Demidov received a Request For Evidence, or RFE notice, from USCIS Texas Service Center.
Specifically, the USCIS adjudicator asked for more information about the significance of various aspects of his work,
including his original scientific contribution to the field, research accomplishments, further evidence of his memberships
and service as a reviewer, and the evidence that he had truly risen to the very top of his field.<br>
<br>
Then, Dr. Demidov ordered the
<a href="http://www.greencardapply.com/rfe/rfe_package_ea.htm" target="_blank"><font color="#006666"> RFE package of EB1-EA petition</font></a> from
us to help him to prepare his response to the RFE requests and questions, and prepared
4 independent
recommendation letters to show that his qualifications met the EB1-EA criteria.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Dr. Demidov maintained a positive attitude throughout this RFE process, and worked hard to collect as much evidence as he
could for the RFE response. Once again, by following the sample reference letters in our RFE package of EB1-EA, which
answer various specific requests and questions asked in the RFE notice, Dr. Demidov worked with his recommenders to
prepare the recommendation letters. We also suggested him and his recommenders to ensure that the letters should explain
the significance of his accomplishments—for example, by describing the extraordinary ways that his individual research
accomplishment had contributed to his field as a whole.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Dr. Demidov prepared a total of three independent recommendation letters for the RFE response. He also collected proof of
his membership in a scientific honor society, which further demonstrated that he had extraordinary ability, and updated
lists of his publications and citations. He also obtained further proof that he had served as a reviewer for two journals
in his field through the editors of the journals.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Based on his supplementary supporting materials, Dr. Demidov wrote a convincing cover letter for the RFE response, by
following the style of our sample of RFE response cover letter in the RFE package of EB1-EA petition, and answered the RFE
requests and questions one-by-one in detail. Dr. Demidov first reaffirmed his extraordinary abilities, then gave in-depth
explanations of his breakthrough innovation in his field. In addition, he cited the independent recommenders’ evaluations
of his contributions to the field.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 After one week of his RFE response package submission, Dr. Demidov received notice that his case had been
approved.&nbsp;</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3. Lessons for Other Alien Applicants&nbsp;</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
<br>
There are a few important lessons that we can learn from Dr. Demidov’s case. First, his case shows the importance of
maintaining a positive attitude and an open mind during the EB1-EA application process. Even though Dr. Demidov was
disappointed to receive an RFE after the initial submission, he worked hard to have a strong, detail, and comprehensive
response.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Second, Dr. Demidov’s case shows that receiving an RFE does not mean that a case is ended to denial, even when the alien
applicant would not be able to respond to each individual request of the RFE at the beginning. For example, Dr. Demidov’s
RFE asked for information about the original scientific contribution to the field, he answered this request by focusing on
his publications, research accomplishments, memberships, and service as a reviewer; his RFE was still approved.<br>
