(RFE) and the Burden of Proving Your Eligibility</font></b>
</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For EB1-Extraordinary Ability
Green Card application, the burden of proving eligibility for the benefit
sought remains entirely on the petitioner, and the petitioner has to meet the burden. When your petition has been poorly
documented, you
may get a notice of the USCIS' unfavorable decision, a written statement of the reason for the negative outcome and an explanation of how to appeal.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">As an
alternative, USCIS may request for additional information or<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>called Request For Evidence (RFE), by sending you a letter and a list
of information and documents it needs to determine your eligibility. You must
respond to such a request within the specified time period, or your petition will be decided on the basis of the already submitted
documents.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">When you file an
EB1-EA Green Card application, the USCIS examiners
have three choices:&nbsp;</font>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) approve the application, or</font>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) deny the application, or</font>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"> 3) request for additional evidence.&nbsp;</font>
</blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">  When a letter of Request For Evidence is sent out, the applicant has
certain time to respond.  Responses to an RFE usually rely on legal arguments to a great extent, in addition to new documentary evidence to satisfy the examiner's requests.
Many approved EB1-EA cases start with a RFE.</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Due to many factors including the weakened job market and slow economy, USCIS has responded by tightening nearly all employment-based visa categories.
With the heightened scrutiny that the USCIS has placed on EB1 and EB2 applications, immigration community reported Requests for
Evidence for even well-prepared cases. This USCIS practice has spilled over to the EB1-Extraordinary Ability
category as well. USCIS is now requiring EB1-Extraordinary Ability applicants to qualify under a stricter and more demanding standard.</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. Understand the Request For Evidence
to Increase Your Chance to Obtain a Green Card</font></b>
</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">There are a lot of complaints with reference to the significant USCIS delays in sending out Requests for Evidence. The USCIS presumes that it is in the U.S. national interest for most foreign nationals seeking Green Cards to undergo Labor Certification. The Labor certification is a competitive recruitment process, where the U.S. employer demonstrates to the U.S. Department of Labor that the employer has not been able to find a qualified U.S. worker to perform the same job duties as the foreign national.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
On the other hand, certain advanced degree professionals or those who are considered "exceptional" and who have demonstrated a significant impact on their selected field, may be eligible for the EB1 or National Interest Waiver (NIW) process.<br>
<br>
From time to time, the immigration community observes that there is an increase in denials of EB1 or NIW cases. Typically, before the USCIS issues a denial in any type of case, it first sends a Request
For Evidence. Receipt of an RFE enables the applicant the opportunity to present additional evidence, for a fair and accurate determination. This procedure is in keeping with the purpose of the EB1
or NIW to create an avenue to obtain permanent resident status for an applicant who demonstrates that her or his work will substantially benefit the U.S.<br>
<br>
In the cases where RFEs are received, the specific requests for documentation have bordered on the bizarre. For example, there was an RFE that the applicant would have to prove that the applicant could not "eventually" train someone else to do their work. Yet we know that any
worker, even an expert, can be replaced "eventually." In fact, every person in the world is ultimately and arguably replaceable, since one could argue that we do not need any more cutting edge research and we can all survive without any new research or development. Such requests have no connection with the intention of the law underlying EB1 or National Interest Waivers.<br>
<br>
Another RFE for an NIW requests evidence that the applicant has obtained awards other than academic awards. That is indeed a strange request, because awards are not one of the mandatory criteria for the NIW category and may arguably be useful to show that a person is "extraordinary." In another case, a candidate's salary was deemed questionably low by the USCIS. But actually, a person's salary is not a criterion for NIW, but rather for the
EB1-Extraordinary Ability process. In NIW cases, requests for evidence of high remuneration are inappropriate.<br>
<br>
There are some cases that the USCIS has been issuing denials without RFEs. Especially frustrating was some petitions that
were summarily denied after waiting for review by USCIS for delayed time period. In other cases, same USCIS Service Center denied the NIW case, but approved EB1-Extraordinary
Ability petition for the same applicant. The denials of the NIW petitions stated that the
applicants failed to meet the "exceptional" standard. This appears to fly in the face of reason, when the USCIS admits that the persons satisfied the higher standard of extraordinary ability for the
EB1 petition, but could not satisfy the lower "exceptional" standard for the EB2
petition.&nbsp;Therefore, if a candidate potentially qualifies for both NIW and EB1, it may be worthwhile considering to file in both categories, to
increase the chance of success for getting the Green Card.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font color="#006666">3</font></b><b><font color="#006666">. Standard Outlined by USCIS Requests for Evidence (RFEs)&nbsp;<br>
      </font></b><br>
      We can learn about USCIS standards from the language of RFEs. Even the best-prepared, strongest cases can get a RFE. USCIS
      often issues generic RFEs without identifying specific aspects of the case the petitioner can readily rectify. It is time-consuming to
      respond to and may be a source of frustration for the petitioner. USCIS RFEs often consist of merely restating statutory language and
      saying the petitioner has not met the burden of proof.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      For example, the standard RFE language for EB1-Extraordinary Ability states:
      <i> “Please submit copies of any published articles by other researchers
      citing or otherwise recognizing your research and/or contributions. . . . It is not necessary to submit articles that are self-referencing; i.e. written by you or your collaborators.”&nbsp;</i><br>
      <br>
      The RFE may adds, <i>“The documentation submitted with the petition
      indicates that the alien petitioner is an accomplished researcher. The
      importance of the research in which he is currently engaged is readily
      apparent. However, it is not apparent that the alien petitioner has the
      level of acclaim required for this visa classification. Please submit any
      available additional evidence that would address the issue of alien
      petitioner's standing in the field in terms of sustained national or
      international acclaim, such as, if applicable, any published material
      about the alien's achievements and career.&quot;</i></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Please note three things from this RFE applicable to
all EB1-Extraordinary Ability cases:</font>
</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) The importance of independent citations and/or a large number of downloads. This can only be shown if one actually has some
        independent citations of one’s papers. If you do not have citations, you can show a download count of your papers or programs by other
        researchers. According to USCIS officers, many independent citations of an applicant’s papers or a large number of downloads of an&nbsp;
        applicant’s papers or programs prove the applicant’s work or achievement has a great impact on his/her
        field.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        2) The importance of the level of acclaim required for EB1-Extraordinary Ability
        classification. This can be shown by strong letters of recommendation testifying about an applicant’s achievements above his/her professional peers by providing specific
        examples of his/her unmatched achievements.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        3) An applicant’s influence on field as a whole. This can be shown by citations or commercialization of patents, but can also be shown
        by use of one’s work by others, which will be brought out by the letters of recommendation. For example, a U.S. Department of
        Agriculture Scientist can talk about how invaluable your research has been for USDA, and two professors who have never met you can talk
        about how your groundbreaking work influenced their published research, or an industry scientist at Monsanto can talk about your
        pioneering research techniques that Monsanto has adopted throughout California and Texas.</font>

National or International Recognition&nbsp;<br>
</b></font><br>
We can also learn about USCIS standards from the language of denials. The language in denial notices also illuminates USCIS standards
and expectations. Of course, just like RFEs, denials can be arbitrary. One USCIS officer may deny a case that other officers would have
granted. Nevertheless, in denials there are patterns. A petition with 15 first-authored publications and 130 independent citations
has a higher chance of approval than a petition with 2 second-authored publications and 8 independent citations.&nbsp;</font>
</p>

      <blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>Example:</i></b> Here is relevant language from a denial notice of a case with 8 first-authored papers but only 5 citations, and with reference
letters that did not speak enough about actual achievements and national or
international recognition:&nbsp;</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The evidence does not
establish that the beneficiary’s invention which received a patent from Taiwan
has proven to be of significance, nor that his other inventions were considered
as significant as of the filing date. Except for the solicited letters of
support, some of which, as indicated above, contains statements not corroborated
by the independent documentation, the evidence does not indicate that as of the
filing date the beneficiary’s original contributions has brought him national
or international recognition as being outstanding.&quot;</font></i>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In other words, the emphasis of a successful
petition must be on actual achievements and national or international
recognition, rather than speculative future benefits. USCIS judges a person’s
achievements and contribution to a field based on past achievements, not speculative
claims about future potential. Thus recommendation letters should focus on substantial accomplishments and influence on the field that
have already occurred rather than future anticipated benefits. As the USCIS denial notice states,
<i> “The petitioner must demonstrate a past history of achievement with some degree of influence on the field as a whole.”&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>
USCIS faults the recommendation letters for not providing <i> “any examples of specific resources that they have adopted or expressed
interest in adopting [petitioner’s] methodologies.” </i> USCIS adds,<i> “Although the petitioner’s research has helped in furthering current
research projects, it has not been established this research has made a significant impact beyond the scope of a particular project.”&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>
Regarding the application with 8 first-authored articles and 5 citations, USCIS notes,
<i> “The petitioner’s publication and citation history is not indicative of a significant influence within the field. . . . in order to establish eligibility, the petitioner must
demonstrate that he already has a track record with some degree of influence on the field as a whole.”&nbsp;</i>
In other words, a large number of independent citations is clearly helpful. In the absence of such evidence, alternative sources of
influence must be found to be able to show some degree of influence on the field as a whole.&nbsp;</font>
