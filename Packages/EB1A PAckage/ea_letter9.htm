<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Re: Dr. Kevin Yong's I-140 Immigrant Petition
for an Alien of Extraordinary Ability</font></i></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear USCIS Officer</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is my pleasure to support Dr. Kevin Yong's
petition for immigration to the United States. I am writing to provide evidence
that his research and development work is exceptional and he has Extraordinary Ability
in research.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Dr. Yong is presently a researcher
at General Electric Research &amp; Development Center (GE R&amp;D Center),
developing the Electronic Document Management System
(EDMS). Dr. Yong is an excellent researcher and
has been working on the EDMS project funded by GE, for the past two years under
my supervision.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Having worked with Dr. Yong since June 2006, I
am impressed with his excellent research and development capabilities. He has a strong
background in mathematics, image processing, and information technology. He also
has deep knowledge associated with electronic document management.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">At GE Power Systems and other GE manufacturer
centers, project documents for
federal government and companies in United States and in other countries need to
be carefully managed. Control of design documents through a product’s life
cycle is also required for regulatory compliance. In traditional engineering
environments, manual document handling and workflow process were used, which may
lead to loss of data and time.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> With Dr. Yong's outstanding research and development in EDMS, it is easy to
access, store, and track many types of documents. Also, electronic forms may be
created to ensure that all information is documented while performing a
procedure. Currently, critical documents and engineering drawings exchanged
between GE and its customers, including U.S. federal government agencies, are managed by
EDMS.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The research and implementation of EDMS also
helps U.S. companies keep a competitive advantage in the international market by
achieving enterprise-wide business and mission critical information management.
Previously, an obsolete&nbsp; program was used to manage Vendor Document (VENDOC) at GE
Power Systems for all documents and drawings exchanged between GE and its
vendors. With the outdated architectures, this
system could not help GE maintain technical competitiveness over its major
foreign competitors, such as ABB and Siemems. Recently, a newly designed VENDOC
process in the EDMS, with secure document revision control and worldwide
document access ability, has replaced the old system. As a principal
researcher, Dr. Yong demonstrated his extraordinary research ability by
integrating new techniques, and he is currently one of the top experts in this
field internationally.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Yong’s
current EDMS research project can
also benefit U.S. government agencies. For example, Tennessee Valley Authority
  (TVA) is an U.S. federal government agency. For
  U.S. government projects, more regulation
requirements need to be met for the recent two TVA projects: TVA-NEW01 and TVA-GALLATIN.
For these projects, GE assumes the entire scope of the power plant design from
the feasibility study to commercialization. The traditional manual Action Item
processing method is not a acceptable solution for projects like TVA.&nbsp;By
applying EDMS in TVA projects, documents exchanged between TVA and GE has been handled by EDMS; quicker response to TVA’s Action Items
  has be performed; and
government’s regulatory and ISO-9002 standard have been met.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">From GE’s annual report, GE’s revenues and
earnings have reached a double-digit growth in 2008. GE Power System relies on
the international market for its growth, and has brought more and more jobs to
our nation since 2006.&nbsp;Dr. Yong
is a principal researcher in the EDMS project at GE, who has effectively solved
difficult theoretical problems and challenging practical problems. After
published eleven research papers in international prestigious journals, such as <i>Journal
of Power Engineering, Information Weekly,</i> and <i>Journal of Document
Management</i>,&nbsp; Dr. Yong
has
established himself as an outstanding researcher in the field of EDMS
and information technology over the past few years. I firmly believe that he
will continue to be a successful researcher in these newly established areas.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I hope this letter will fully support Dr. Yong’s
petition in EB1 Extraordinary Ability
category, so he can continue his research and
development projects in EDMS and other related information technology fields. If I can be of further assistance in support of his
immigration application, please feel free to contact me. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sincerely yours</font></p>
