<p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">1. It Is not Enough to List
Your Evidence and Expect that the USCIS Examiner Will Approve Your Application</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">  The USCIS has repeatedly stated that the significance of each type of evidence must be evaluated by
examiners, which also means that simply providing minimal evidence of three types is not sufficient for
an EB1-Extraordinary Ability
petition approval.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">  The USCIS examiners have broad discretion to evaluate the evidence. It is not enough to provide basic documentation to satisfy the regulations.
An examiner will go through the evidence and decide if it is substantial enough to distinguish you in some
way from the rest of your peers.
Probably 99% of cases which are denied by the USCIS are denied on subjective grounds. Basically, it is not enough to list your evidence and expect that the examiner will approve your application.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The USCIS has raised the bar higher than before for obtaining classification as an EB1-Extraordinary Ability. However, the USCIS' decisions remain consistent over the past
years, and stick clearly to the statute and regulations. It does appear that the EB1-Extraordinary Ability
category may be moving toward a higher standard of review, paralleling similar patterns in
National Interest Waiver and
EB1-Outstanding Ability adjudications.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Specifically, there have been RFEs (Request For Evidence) from USCIS regarding the
research experience, national or international recognition, and the nature of the position. However, USCIS decisions are firmly grounded in the statute and regulations. Therefore, it is very important for
alien applicants to carefully present
eligibility and strong evidence for the
USCIS Service Center to approve your case.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">You can present direct evidence towards a criterion, or you can
      argue that some of your achievement should be considered as an equivalent or comparable evidence towards the criterion.
      But most importantly, you should not be afraid to try, and keep in mind that a denied EB1-Extraordinary Ability
      immigration petition will not affect your future other immigration petitions through the same category or
      in different categories. If you can qualify for
      EB1-Extraordinary Ability, you
      may also qualify for EB1-Outstanding Researcher or Professor (which needs employer's
      sponsorship), or NIW.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. Petition Strategies
      for EB1-Extraordinary Ability Application</font></b></font></p>

      <blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">1) Evaluate your case carefully: </font></b><font size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
</span> EB1-Extraordinary Ability <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">category
is meant to be restrictive. Not everyone has extraordinary ability. The USCIS
has been restrictive in its interpretation of the EB1-EA regulations.
Well-crafted advocacy, however, can defend an EB1-EA petition. More is not
necessarily better. Sometimes petitioners submit mountains of documents
arbitrarily, but busy USCIS adjudicators can be overwhelmed and annoyed by
unnecessary bulk.&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Therefore, you should evaluate your case
carefully. You may want to discuss the standard with your employer or friends,
and if possible, with your supervisor or mentor, to evaluate whether the EB1-Extraordinary Ability
classification applies and whether the necessary evidence can be gathered. Detailed initial intakes will help manage expectations, avoid delays due to RFEs, and reduce the chance of a denial. Careful analysis not only weeds out weak
case, but also may help identify your accomplishments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">2) A clear and easy to read cover letter: </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">Not all USCIS examiners are college educated, and none are likely to be experts in your specialized field. Additionally, USCIS examiners have a very limited amount of time to read all the materials in each petition,
with less than 30 minutes in most cases. Present your accomplishments and qualifications in general terms. This is especially important in the peer recommendation letters and in the petition cover letter. A clear and easy to read cover letter should make the petition more easily navigable for someone who is not familiar with the material.</font></font></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">A good
cover letter with a brief summary showing exactly how the beneficiary meets the
regulatory requirements is important. Equally important is a clear document or
exhibit index, and clearly set forth the evidence attached and how it satisfies
the criterion in question. Setting out an easy to follow roadmap for the
adjudicator is a key.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>3) Be selective and include only strong evidence:</b>
As a practical matter, include only the first two pages of each journal publication, and the first few pages of each peer letter-writer’s CV. For example, each publication and each CV could be 10 pages long, which can make the package quite unwieldy.
USCIS examiners are not impressed by the volume of material submitted; in fact,
an examiner might be more likely to set aside a particularly large submission in favor of a shorter one. Be selective and include only
strong evidence. Do not “pad” the petition with documentation that does not clearly make your point. Meeting
three or four of the ten EB1-Extraordinary Ability criteria with strong evidence is probably better than marginal evidence for additional categories.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>4) To
win your petition, good and persuasive arguments need to be presented: </b>Since the USCIS has not created any checklists, the examiner
must be persuaded that your case has merit. If the argument is
too long and boring, the examiner will lose interest before
understanding the merits of the case. If the argument is too
short and unconvincing, the examiner will not be persuaded. A successful case strikes the right balance between sufficient
detail and argument to establish eligibility, without unnecessary
repetition or the inclusion of irrelevant facts or arguments.
More than any other types of cases, this kind of petition is won or lost
on the strength of the arguments presented.</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">You
need to explain how you have performed well beyond what is normally required of
others in your position. For example, corroborated in the reference letters for
the original contributions criterion, the reference letter writer may explain it
is true that academics are expected to publish, but point out that this
particular person has published truly significant work, and has produced more
volumes of published material than the average academics.&nbsp;</font></span></font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>5) This is the wrong time to be humble about yourself:</b>
        Keep in mind that you are making a case which sets you apart from the rest of your peers. Therefore, the evidence that you present with your application should clearly set you apart from others in your field.
        You should always present the strongest case possible. This is the wrong time to be humble about your achievements.
        The USCIS adjudicating officer will be looking for extraordinary ability which sets you apart from your
        peers, so you should clearly say that your abilities are above the average.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Therefore, you should not use humble words. For example, if your job responsibilities could be that of a
        &quot;Visiting Scholar&quot;, or a &quot;Research Scholar&quot; , or a &quot;Research Scientist&quot;,&nbsp;
        or
        &quot;Lab Technician&quot;, do not claim to be the &quot;Lab
        Technician&quot;.
        The "Research Scientist" or &quot;Research Scholar&quot; sounds much better.
        Also, a &quot;Research Assistant&quot; or &quot;Teaching Assistant&quot; is very hard to claim to have
        &quot;Extraordinary Ability&quot;; think of other names which give you a better title, but at the same time does not distort the nature of your job. Please keep in mind that giving incorrect evidence may seriously harm your application, and can be detrimental to any of your future applications too.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>6) If
it is possible, file your petition with a specific job offer which
clearly describes the work that will be done:</b> Technically, job offer is NOT required for
        an EB1-Extraordinary Ability
petition. For
this reason, it is possible for intending immigrants to
self-petition. The way the law is drafted, it is the Labor Certification that is
waived, and the job offer is not required. A person seeking an EB1-Extraordinary Ability
petition must offer
persuasive evidence that he or she has engaged in work of which his or her performance
        has been excellent. The
easiest way to do this is with a specific job offer which clearly
describes the work that will be done.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As stated in USCIS regulations, <i> "No offer of employment required. Neither an offer for employment in the United States nor a labor certification is required for this classification."</i> However, the petition must be accompanied by clear evidence that the alien is coming to the United States to continue work in the area of expertise. Such evidence may include letters from prospective employers, evidence of prearranged commitments such as contracts, or a statement from the beneficiary detailing plans on how he or she intends to continue his or her work in the United States.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even though USCIS may waive the requirement for you to have current employment, that
        does not mean that a job is not important. In fact, you should always
        state in your petition any kind of relevant job that your currently have, and indicate that your future goal is to dedicate your extraordinary ability to the
benefits of this country. Having a job guarantees that you are capable of supporting yourself, and that you are using the extraordinary capabilities that you are claiming in your application.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>7) The requirement of intention to
        continue work in the field: </b>Aliens of extraordinary ability do not need an employer or other sponsor. However, they must be coming to the United States
        <i> "to continue work in the area of expertise.''</i> It is enough to show that such aliens will continue to work in their field of expertise. There is no specific requirement that they pursue the specific topics of research that brought them sustained acclaim.
        The EB1-EA category is achievement based, and you should also prove that you intend to continue working in your field.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Strictly speaking, the alien of extraordinary ability need not
        to seek “employment” in the United States. The alien must, however,
        come to the U.S. to continue to work in the area of the alien’s extraordinary ability. Thus, the alien
        may present employment offers, prearranged commitments, arrangements to engage in self-employment, or other evidence showing that the alien will continue to work in the area of the alien’s extraordinary
        ability.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>8) Be
sure to emphasize the innovative side of your work:</b> The key issue for EB1-Extraordinary Ability
petition is how to collect evidence to
prove your work is at the top of your field. Your work can be teaching, and it does not have to be
research. It is a common understanding, however, that scientific
research and technology development keeps this country&#146;s
economy strong. So, be sure to emphasize the innovative side of
your work.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">9)
Need to explain the awards, prizes, grants and fellowships</font></span></b><font size="2">: D<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">o
not just attach evidence of awards, prizes, grants and fellowships. Your need to
set forth the criteria for the award and explain how the awards were in fact
based upon past achievements. Award of NIH grants, for example, are based on the
review committee’s evaluation of not only the proposed project, but also the
individuals on the research team.</span></font></font></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">10)
State the ways in judge of others’ work</font></span></b><font face="Arial" size="2">: <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">To
successfully satisfy this criterion, you should, if possible, submit a letter
from the editor of the journal that you have reviewed for, stating that you were
chosen as a peer reviewer based on your expertise in the subject matter.</span>
Also, you <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">may want to state how the
ways in which you have acted as a judge of others’ work is qualitatively
different from others asked to serve as judges. For example, you can stressed
that you were specifically appointed by the President of the university to serve
on a panel reviewing candidates for the Provost position, the chief academic
officer of the university.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>11) It is best to provide not only scholarly
articles, but also include the citations by others - a Citation Search Report</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The USCIS regularly held that unless there is evidence that independent researchers have cited an applicant’s work, the authorship of scholarly articles is not enough to show the applicant’s exceptional ability. To satisfy this consideration, it is best to provide evidence of the authorship of scholarly articles, the citation of the articles by other scholars, and the merit of the publishing journals themselves.<br>
<br>
If you mention your accomplishment in petition, USCIS adjudicator may not believe you. So you need a
<b><i><u> Citation Search Report</u></i></b> as one of your evidence, and you may provide impact factor for the journals where you published papers. In one
EB1-EA case, the alien applicant has 6 publications that were never cited. The USCIS' respond is: "no citations means no recognition of your work." This sounds reasonable.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
For EB1-EA petitions, letters of recommendation are important but not sufficient. You must provide convincing evidences, and you can overcome the requirements by demonstrating the importance of your research, journal papers, citations, patents, etc. You can also ask the referees to write letters stating that you are indeed recognized in your field.<br>
<br>
For citation search tools, the <i> Google Scholar, Scopus, SciFinder</i>, and <i> ISI Web of Science</i> provide more citation search results. Also, if you have reviewed papers, you may have access to
<i> Scopus.</i></font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">12) If you do not have a few good reference
letters:</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"> If you do not have a few good reference letters, you may
consider other methods of showing that experts in your field have recognized your work. For example, go into more detail about the journals which published your articles, perhaps
with a thorough discussion of the peer review process with notes about the types of experts chosen as manuscript
reviewers. Also talk at length about the actual or potential benefits of your work. Show statistics which paint a clear picture of the importance of your work.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">13) Discuss the economic benefits of your
work:</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"> You may also discuss the economic benefits of your work, if applicable. For medical researchers, economic statistics can be discussed together with human suffering from conditions which you study.
Also, y<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">ou may
want to stress the social importance of your work. For example, experience has
shown that if an applicant’s work may be tied to some medical breakthrough or
a significant national social or political benefit, the </span> EB1-Extraordinary Ability
petition<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"> was more likely to be granted.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Above all, remember that the examiner is a human being, so there is some information which will have a stronger psychological impact than other information. Trial lawyers talk about "jury psychology", and here you can think the “examiner psychology.” Make the examiner realize that your work is important and that they can feel good about approving your
case.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">14) If
you do not have many publications, it is not a problem:</font></b>
<font size="2">
If you want to apply for Green Card under EB1-Extraordinary Ability category, but do not have many
publications, it is not a problem. Having many publications are nice,
but not necessary. In fact, there are many applicants who do not have
many publications,
but have rather strong reference letters and have got their cases
approved. Remember, always try to emphasize the significance of
your work and your extraordinary performance in the research; do not be
discouraged about fewer publications.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">15) Prevailing
Wage is not an issue for the petition:</font></b> <font size="2"> Since the
U.S. Department of Labor is not involved,
the &quot;prevailing wage&quot; is not an issue. Obviously, if the
salary offered is high, then the overall package will look better; if the salary offered is low, the applicant
will have to explain why he or she is earning substantially less
than that of his or her peers. If the answer is that the applicant is engaged in research at
an institution where similarly employed researchers are paid
similar salaries, then this should not be a problem. Also, if the
applicant is working</font></font><font size="2" face="Arial"> for a non-profit institution, this may explain a low salary. The
USCIS will expect a
person working for a for-profit entity to earn a salary that is
equal to or higher than that paid to similarly qualified
professionals working for similar companies.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>16) The requirement of
benefiting the United States prospectively: </b>Aliens who intend to work in the area of their extraordinary ability or exceptional ability
should substantially benefit the interests of the United States in some fashion,
and these aliens may pass this test without submitting additional documentation. The USCIS regulations do not specifically require evidence on this issue. However, according to the USCIS, there may be very rare instances where an extraordinary alien's admission may be damaging or detrimental to the interests of the United States.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>17) A “play for the kickback” strategy:</b>
Some applicants have reported that they follow a “play for the kickback” strategy of submitting a basic petition, holding back some evidence, and waiting for
a RFE from USCIS. It is not recommended to follow this practice, because of the
problem of submitting documentation dated after the initial filing.&nbsp;</font></p>
