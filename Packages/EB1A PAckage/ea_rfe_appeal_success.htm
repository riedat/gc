  Service Center</span> director denied the petition, finding that the evidence is insufficient to
  demonstrate that the beneficiary qualified as an alien of extraordinary
  ability. Upon review, the AAO determined that the beneficiary did qualify for EB1-EA
  classification by meeting three of the extraordinary ability standards:</o:p>
  </span></font></span></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">1) The Extraordinary Ability Criterion #4:

  </font>

 </b><font size="2">Evidence of the
  alien's participation, either individually or on a panel, as a judge of the
  work of others in the same or an allied field of specification for which
  classification is sought.

  </font>

  </font>

  </p>
  <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">For the
  fourth criterion, the University submitted evidence of the
  beneficiary’s work serving as a reviewer of manuscripts submitted to the <i>
  Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery</i> and the <i> American Journal of
  Physiology</i>. The employer also exhibited documentation of the beneficiary’s
  work reviewing the research proposals of his peers. The TSC Director determined
  that the beneficiary was not judging the work of others in this instance, but
  rather the merit of their grant proposals. <o:p></font></span></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">Also,
  </font> </span><font size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">the employer submitted a letter from the associate editor of the
  <i>
  American Journal of Physiology</i>, stating that
  the beneficiary was selected to perform peer review based on his expertise in
  the subject matter.<o:p>
  </o:p>The AAO
  determined that the beneficiary satisfied this criterion.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">2) The Extraordinary Ability Criterion #5:
  </font> </b><font size="2">Evidence of the
  alien's original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or
  business-related contributions of major significance in the field.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"></o:p>
  </span></font></font></p>
  <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
  employer submitted numerous testimonials about the value of the
  beneficiary’s work and his individual qualities. Initially, the employer
  submitted seven testimonials. The TSC
  originally determined that many of these
  testimonials had failed to state how the beneficiary had
  made an original contribution of major significance to the field. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
  employer then submitted two additional testimonials, one from the World
  Governor of the International College of Surgeons and one from the director of
  the petitioner’s transplant center. The employer also asserted that the
  beneficiary satisfied this criterion by virtue of his diagnosis and correction
  of a heart device malfunction. The discovery was published in the <i> Journals of
  Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery</i> and resulted in a design change in the
  device. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The AAO
  determined that the beneficiary satisfied this criterion. According to the AAO,
  the beneficiary made a significant contribution to his field of endeavor by
  discerning a heart device defect and by reporting it, both to the manufacturer
  that implemented the design changes, and to his peers who took necessary steps
  to avoid injuring patients, thereby impacting his field.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">3) The Extraordinary Ability Criterion #6:

  <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
  employer submitted evidence that the beneficiary authored more than 25
  scholarly articles that were published in professional journals and
  co-authored a book chapter and two books. A citation history of the articles
  was submitted as evidence of the beneficiary’s acclaim.<o:p>
  </o:p>Both
  the TSC Director and the AAO determined that the beneficiary satisfied this
  criterion.<o:p>

  establishments that have a distinguished reputation.</font>

  </font>

  </p>
  <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">For
  this criterion, the employer submitted evidence that the beneficiary was
  the co-investigator on seven clinical trials, including two NIH funded
  research projects, in addition to being a fellow at the University of
  Wisconsin, and a fellow, resident, and assistant professor at the
  University of Kentucky. The employer also asserted that the beneficiary acted
  as a critical and irreplaceable member of the petitioner’s ongoing
  transplant patient, teaching, research and clinical care program, supported by
  testimonials from the employer’s transplant center.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font size="2">The
  employer also submitted evidence that the beneficiary was the principal
  investigator of two ongoing research programs, and the winner of awards from
  the Governor of Kentucky and the State of West Virginia. The petitioning
  organization noted that it is federally designated as a heart transplant
  center and that such designation is evidence of the petitioner’s national
  prestige.</o:p></font></span> <font size="2"> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Despite
