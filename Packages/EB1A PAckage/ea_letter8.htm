<p><font size="2" face="Arial">RE: 1-140 form petition of EB1
 Extraordinary Ability for Dr. Jassu Gupta</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear USCIS officer:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This letter is written in support of Dr. Jassu Gupta's
Form I-140 petition for EB1 Extraordinary Ability.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I came to know Dr. Gupta and his extraordinary research ability
in my capacity as a director of the Sensors and Electron Devices
Directorate, U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL). Dr. Gupta is an Assistant
Professor in
the Electrical Engineering Department at the Stanford University, and he has been working as a Research Associate in
the Electro-Optics/Znfrared (EO/IR) Image Processing Branch of the Signal and
Image Processing Division at ARL since January 2006. His research
is focused on the development of image and video compression algorithms for military
applications such as digitization of the battlefield.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Army Research Laboratory's Sensors and
Electron Devices Directorate (SEDD) is the principal Army organization for
research and exploratory development of electron device and sensor technologies
for Army battlefield applications. For the acquisition of digitized information,
such as the location and identification of military targets from a battle-space
through limited bandwidth channels, effective image and video compression
techniques are essential. These techniques are used to compress the battlefield
imagery, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR)
imagery that contain targets. Developing efficient image and video compression
techniques is also related to the performance of the Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) technique that can actually locate and identify the targets.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A sad lesson learned by our armed forces during
the Operation Desert Storm is the inability to distinguish between the friendly
and hostile vehicles or equipment under poor visibility conditions.
Consequently, more than half of the American casualties were inflicted by the so
called &quot;friendly fires&quot;.&nbsp;Certainly, we should not let the same tragedy
to occur again, To overcome similar problems in the future, we need Automatic
Target Recognition (ATR) systems that are effective and efficient in
distinguishing enemy and friendly targets under adverse environmental
conditions. Currently, a number of ATR projects related to different military
applications are funded by the U.S. Army and the other branches. In the long run,
these efforts could significantly contribute to the safety of our troop and the
security of our nation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Gupta
performed excellent research work on the Face Recognition
Technology (FERET) program which was sponsored by the Department of Defense
Counter-drug Technology Development Program Office, with ARL serving as the
technical agent. The primary mission of the FERET program was to develop
automatic face recognition capabilities that can be employed to assist security,
intelligence, and law enforcement personnel in the performance of their duties.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
In 2006, the major task of the FERET program, a government-monitored testing and
evaluation of face recognition algorithms using standardized database and test
procedures, was successfully performed. The availability of the FERET database
and evaluation methodology has made a significant difference in the progress of
developing accurate face-recognition algorithms.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Gupta
demonstrated his extraordinary research ability on the development of the
FERET program in several areas: the active development of algorithms, the
availability of a large database of facial images, and a method for evaluating
the performance of face recognition algorithms. With his knowledge and
dedication, Dr. Gupta has cultivated a number of successes in the FERET program. He
has designed novel evaluation algorithms and has developed several
innovative face recognition classifiers by integrating techniques, such as
vector quantization (VQ) and principal component analysis (PCA). Recently, his successful experiments have shown exciting results in terms of detection and
classification rates, and some of his research results were reported in several
international journals in this field.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of face
recognition classifiers, Dr. Gupta designed various projection-based techniques. His
face recognition classifiers have proved to work very well on a large database of
facial images and to achieve a stabilized classification capability, which was
highly prized by academic experts.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Working on the FERET project, Dr. Gupta has made two
original and very important contributions in the field. The first contribution is a creative design of the
FERET database and evaluation methodology, thereby moving face recognition
technology entered into a new era. The second contribution is that the FERET
test has convinced the biometric community that face recognition is a key area
of scientific endeavor. Dr. Gupta conducts the experiments thoroughly and produces appropriate
results in a timely manner. He has assisted other research efforts in the EO/IR
Image Processing Branch by giving insightful suggestions.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ATR projects are of great importance to U.S. Army
due to their versatility in many military activities. An effective
ATR system that converts battlefield data into information for subsequent action
is a critical aid for our soldiers. The Army and other services have allocated
sufficient resources for the development of ATR systems to maintain the
technological advantages of our military forces.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> I truly believe that Dr. Gupta
has extraordinary research ability, and his research efforts will
benefit the security, strength, and prosperity of our nation. Please approval
  his I-140 immigration petition based on his academic achievement.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sincerely yours,</font></p>
