    </o:p>
    </font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">As a Research Scientist
    in a full time position, I am currently employed by the Earth System Science
    Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC) at the University of California, Irvine. My
    research projects are based on the development and application of short-term
    forecast of clouds associated with severe weather using Geostationary
    Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), and the satellite rainfall
    estimation using passive microwave algorithms and thermal infrared channels
    onboard LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellites. These research activities are
    complemented with the statistical evaluation of different satellite rainfall
    retrievals over the United States and South America. My research activities
    can be applied directly to protect American life and property, save natural
    resources, and bring immediate benefits to the national interests of the
    United States.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">The University of
    California at Irvine is recognized as one of the most important institutions
    in the United States in the Earth Science, and it is also a leader in
    atmospheric sciences research and education. While there is no explicit
    ranking for the Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC), the
    Geosciences at the University of California at Irvine is 15th worldwide and
    4th among U.S. public universities, based on a citations analysis by the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ISI
    Web of Knowledge</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Thomson
    Reuters</i> over the period of last ten years for the most cited
    institutions in Geosciences.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">Among the four major
    research areas at ESSIC, the global water cycle is central to nearly every
    aspect of the global climate and crucial to human welfare. Inter-annual
    changes in precipitation and evaporation are associated with droughts and
    floods that threaten the lives and livelihood of millions of people in the
    United States and all over the world. Due to the global climate changes and
    global warming, evidence indicates that the global hydrological cycle may be
    accelerating, resulting in an increasing number of extreme precipitation
    events. Improving our understanding of the ways that water influences the
    integrated Earth System is a critical component of our ongoing effort to
    predict climate variations and anticipate global climate change.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">As a long-time
    researcher in the satellite meteorology field, I primarily conduct research
    on short-term forecasts of clouds associated with severe weather and
    satellite rainfall estimation by applying the passive microwave algorithms
    and thermal infrared channels. There is significant U.S. national interest
    in developing new methods to serve the society’s needs for weather and
    water information.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">I obtained both Bachelor
    Degree and Master Degree in Meteorology from the University of Sao Paulo (USP),
    Brazil, in 1999. Pursuing my interests in hydrometeorology after graduation,
    I accepted a research position in the National Institute of Weather Service
    of Brazil. There, my research interests were centered on precipitation
    spatial distribution, with particular interest in establishing links between
    rainfall and river discharge over major rivers. I finished a project to
    develop new strategies to improve and validate satellite rainfall estimates
    over Brazil, which was partially sponsored by U.S. National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The results of my outstanding research,
    the first satellite rainfall estimation for flash flood applications over
    Brazil, were published in the NOAA Technical Report No.193 in May 2005.
    Because of my excellent research accomplishments, I received an Outstanding
    Research Award from the institution in 2005 (Exhibits 1, 2).</font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">In order to broaden the
    scope of my research on hydrometeorology, I accepted a fellowship grant from
    the Japanese government in the National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan in
    January, 2006. My research work in Japan was focused on the application of
    remote sensing technologies to study the life cycle of mesoscale convective
    clouds. My original methodology to study the physical process of severe
    weather-related clouds using satellite information was published in the
    International Journal of Remote Sensing (Exhibit 3, 4). <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">In September 2006, I was
    enrolled in a PhD program in Atmospheric Sciences at the Ohio State
    University. My research projects were related to the tracking and
    forecasting of mesoscale convective clouds and the development of new
    algorithms for rainfall estimation over both North American and South
    American regions. My research projects were sponsored by National Science
    Foundation and U.S. National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">As indicated in the
    National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration Strategic Plan for next
    five years, the occurrence of floods, droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes and
    other severe weather events can cause $11.4 billion in damage each year in
    the United States. Weather is directly linked to public health and safety,
    and nearly one-third of the U.S. economy is sensitive to weather and
    climate. With such importance, NOAA’s role in understanding, observing,
    forecasting, and warning of environmental events is expanding. NOAA will
    continue to collect and analyze environmental data and to issue forecasts
    and warnings that will protect health, life, and property and enhance the
    U.S. economy. Future needs can be better met by exploring new concepts and
    applications through robust weather and water research. A commitment to
    public benefits shapes NOAA’s role within the U.S. weather enterprises,
    including its partners in the private sector, academia, and government.
    These partners add value to NOAA services and help disseminate critical
    environmental information.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">In order to satisfy
    people’s needs for weather and water information, the environmental
    satellites are major components of NOAA’s global efforts to better
    observe, understand, and predict various environmental phenomena. The
    backbone of the NOAA satellites includes the Geostationary Operational
    Environmental Satellite (GOES) and Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental
    Satellite (POES) programs. GOES and POES are operated to provide critical
    atmospheric, oceanic, climatic, solar, and space data to protect life and
    property across the United States. These satellites carry scientific
    instruments and communications equipments to support the delivery of weather
    information. NOAA is acquiring the new generation of each satellite system,
    including ground processing systems. In concert with the National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), acquisition of the
    next-generation geostationary satellite (GOES-R) series is underway. The
    Department of Defense (DOD), NASA, and NOAA are joined with industry
    partners to build the follow-on series of polar orbiting satellites - the
    National Polar Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOES).
    NOAA’s satellite systems support other NOAA offices in the delivery of
    improved severe storm warnings, weather forecasts, climate predictions,
    oceanic and ecosystems research and analyses.<o:p>

    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">During my PhD research,
    I improved the ForTraCC (Forecasting and Tracking the Evolution of Cloud
    Clusters) algorithm and made significant contribution to the field. The
    ForTraCC is used to track and forecast the development of convective clouds.
    The ForTraCC technique depicts the main morphological features of the cloud
    systems, and most importantly it reconstructs the entire life cycle. Based
    on the information, several relationships that use the area expansion and
    convective are employed to predict the life time duration and cloud area.
    Because of these features, the civil defense and power companies can use the
    information to mitigate the damages in the population. Further development
    and applications in ForTraCC include the integration of satellite rainfall
    retrievals, radar fields and thunderstorm initiation.<o:p>

    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">After receiving my PhD
    in July 2010 with outstanding achievements in the field, I joined the Earth
    System Science Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC) at the University of
    California, Irvine, as a Research Scientist. During the last four years, I
    have been working on developing several techniques to improve the knowledge
    in different aspects of satellite rainfall retrieval. The development and
    application of these techniques (some of them are currently implemented in
    the operational algorithm at the U.S. National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric
    Administration/National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information
    Service; NOAA/NESDIS) play a key role in the suite of rainfall products that
    NOAA/NESDIS offers to the user community in the United States and all over
    the world.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">In my current position
    as a Research Scientist at the University of California, Irvine, I continue
    to excel, and have made major contributions to the field. My extraordinary
    research ability and significant contributions in the short-term forecast
    and satellite rainfall field have been expanding and recognized nationally
    and internationally. The results of my research project “Mesoscale
    Convective System Climatology using Geostationary Infrared Imagery”, where
    I act as principal investigator, has been incorporated in the GOES-R product
    suite, which is scheduled to launch on January of next year (Exhibit 5).<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">I am a full and voting
    member of American Meteorological Society (AMS), which provides the
    scientific community with platforms to discuss and promote the newest
    achievements in meteorology, atmospheric science and related fields. I am
    also a senior member of the International Precipitation Working Group (IPWG),
    which is a permanent Working Group of the Coordination Group for
    Meteorological Satellites (CGMS) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
    This group focuses the scientific community’s attention on operational and
    research satellite based quantitative precipitation measurement issues and
    challenges.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">In summary, I have
    established a track record of excellence in Atmospheric Science and
    Satellite Meteorology research, and I am an internationally recognized
    scientist with extraordinary ability in the field. I will continue to work
    in the field of my excellence. In the following sections, I will provide
    evidence to demonstrate that I meet the eligibility requirements of
    EB1-Extraordinary Ability petition, and I am one of the very few who have
    risen to the top of my field of expertise. I will also prove that my
    research work justifies the future projections of benefits to the U.S.
    national interest, and my extraordinary research ability outweighs the
    interests in preserving the Labor Certification process in this case.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">My research work and my
    scientific and professional contributions can be useful to protect life and
    property, save natural resources, and bring great benefits to the national
    interests of the United States. In order for an applicant to be deemed as
    the Alien of Extraordinary Ability, the immigration regulations require that
    the alien applicant must meet at least three of the ten criteria outlined in
    the regulations.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">Here, I will provide
    evidence to show that I meet four of the ten necessary requirements for an
    EB1-Extraordinary Ability petition, which clearly indicates that I am an
    alien with extraordinary ability in Atmospheric Science and Satellite
    Meteorology. An examination of these four criteria is discussed below in
    depth:</font></p>

    </font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">Continuous and reliable
    precipitation information is crucial for a myriad of applications ranging
    from energy production to food safety. However, measuring precipitation is
    one of the most difficult challenges of meteorology, because precipitation
    occurs intermittently and with pronounced geographic and temporal
    variability. Surface observations alone are inadequate for observing
    precipitation over the ocean and unpopulated areas. On the other hand,
    satellite-based sensors can observe the entire earth.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">In conjunction with
    comprehensive, accurate ground validation and calibration, satellites offer
    the only realistic prospect for accurate and continuous measurement of
    precipitation. As pointed out in the previous paragraphs, several
    meteorological satellite missions are being scheduled for the next decade
    and beyond. The next-generation geostationary satellite (GOES-R) series will
    provide significant improvements in technology over current GOES series with
    improved resolution (4X), faster coverage (5X), broader bands (2X), and more
    coverage simultaneously.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">The evidence of my
    original scientific and scholarly research contributions of major
    significance to the academic field can be summarized in the following two
    projects that I finished on the current position at the University of
    California at Irvine.<o:p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">The results of this
    research on “Mesoscale Convective System Climatology using Geostationary
    Infrared Imagery” will be incorporated in the GOES-R product suite that
    will be produced soon after launch scheduled for next year. The aim of this
    project is to use a cloud tracking methodology to track Mesoscale Convective
    Systems (MCS) through their entire life cycle using data from the new
    Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) sensor onboard GOES-R. This information could
    be useful for forecasting changes in MCS intensity that can be related to
    quantitative precipitation estimation. The incorporation of any useful
    findings into the operational GOES-R nowcasting algorithm and quantitative
    precipitation estimation program is among the expected outcomes of this
    project. (Exhibits 5, 6)</font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">The modified ForTrACC
    methodology, fully described in my paper published at <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Weather
    and Forecasting</i> (Exhibits 7), is the best choice to perform this task.
    The cloud cluster detection techniques are based on a fully configurable
    cloud top threshold temperature, a tracking algorithm for overlapping areas
    in successive images, and a forecast module for the evolution of each
    particular storm system in previous steps. <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">The modified ForTrACC
    methodology has also been tested over the Pacific Ocean to study the life
    cycle of severe-weather related clouds and its relationship with cirrus
    clouds embedded on them. My paper “Deep convection over the Eastern
    Tropical Pacific Observed by TRMM and GOES-W”, which is part of the
    Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) special issue, was published by

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">My extraordinary ability
    in research and algorithm development has been addressed by Dr. Lee Pender,
    who is an independent expert and a principal research scientist at the
    MIT’s Center for Global Change Science, in his letter of recommendation
    that: “Dr. Silva developed an unique algorithm and operative system that
    allows tracking and forecasting the position and intensity of convective
    systems along its life cycle in the ForTrACC - Forecast and Tracking of
    Active Cloud Clusters. This new development and original contribution to the
    field demonstrated his extraordinary ability in science, and allowed him to
    stand out from his peers because this algorithm was the first operative tool
    to run 7/24 to produce short-term forecast of clouds associated with severe
    weather in United States and South America, which has been used by many
    researchers in the field incliding our research group at MIT. This was also
    the first experience of short-term severe weather forecast using satellite
    imagery at continental scale in the world, which also indicates that Dr.
    Silva is one of the very few who have risen to the top of his field of
    expertise.” (Exhibit 9)<o:p>

    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Tommy Mayo, a senior
    researcher at NOAA’s Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites,
    also indicated my outstanding research ability and achievements in his
    reference letter: “Dr. Silva’s research has greatly extended the
    nowcasting models and made original contributions in the field, because
    these problems are extremely important and difficult to solve. For example,
    nowcasting, which is the prediction of severe storms in the time frame of
    0-3 hours, is not feasible with conventional weather prediction models
    because those models are not stable during the first few hours of their
    prediction cycle. Severe storms account for much destruction of property and
    life, and their timely forecasts are of national concern. It is necessary to
    develop and use new models and techniques, such as those developed by Dr.
    Silva, to effectively solve this problem by using satellite imagery and data
    for short-term forecast of clouds associated with severe weather (Exhibit
    10).</font></p>

    Two: Analysis and Improvement of Satellite Derived Global Hydrological
    Products – Passive Microwave Applications</font></u></i></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">After I joined ESSIC at
    the University of California, Irvine, I also conducted a research project in
    the improvement of several hydrological products using passive microwave
    channels onboard LEO satellites, which was sponsored by National Science
    Foundation and NOAA.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">The hydrological
    products like integrated Cloud Liquid Water (CLW) and Total Perceptible
    Water (TPW) have been produced since 1987 for global monthly rainfall
    estimation, by using the measurements from the Defense Meteorological
    Satellite Program (DMSP) series of Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI).
    The objectives of my research on passive microwave applications are
    monitoring and retrieving the atmospheric and surface parameters, such as
    precipitation, sea ice, ocean surface wind speed, and cloud liquid water
    among other products using the first Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder
    (SSMI/S).<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">My research focused on
    the application of SSMI/S channels to improve the performance of several
    hydrological products by significantly modifying the existing algorithms for
    SSMI. An inter-calibration methodology is developed for this application
    which is based on direct linear mapping for Simultaneous Conical
    Observations (SCO) between SSMI F15 and SSMI/S F16. After applying the
    proposed scheme, the statistical analysis performed with this SCO dataset
    shows lower bias and higher correlation between SSMI and SSMI/S retrievals.
    The time series analysis also shows that this scheme is not time dependant.
    This fact is a key issue for using SSMI/S retrievals to continue the SSMI-based
    hydrological data set. These data sets are an outstanding source of climate
    data to perform many research activities. General circulation and climate
    models, including those to perform future scenarios of climate change, could
    be fed with these satellite-derived rainfall retrievals.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">The study of the
    hydrological cycle and the variability of the climate system is one of the
    most challenge activities in the climate research field. Based on my
    original research results, my paper “Evaluation and Improvement of AMSU
    Precipitation Retrievals”, published in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Journal
    of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres</i> which is a major journal in the
    field of geophysics, has been widely accepted and cited in the geophysical
    research community. My research technique is based on a statistical-based
    model to correct the systematic bias in AMSU-B rainfall retrievals using a
    Gaussian function with multiple parameters, such as viewing angle, latitude
    and surface type. This methodology has been successfully transitioned into
    the NOAA/NESDIS environment as part of the operational Microwave Surface and
    Precipitation Products System (MSPPS) which provides near real-time surface
    precipitation products. (Exhibits 11, 12)<o:p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">As an independent expert
    in climate diagnostics in the Department of Soil, Water, and Climate at
    University of Minnesota, Prof. Paul Korzeniowski wrote in his letter of
    reference that “The changes in the global distribution of precipitation
    are a crucial element to monitor climate change, and yet we depend on
    indirect, remotely-sensed estimates of precipitation from satellites for
    over 75% of the planet. Therefore, it is vital for Dr. Silva’s research to
    make these estimates as accurate as possible with improved technology. It is
    my professional opinion that Dr. Silva has demonstrated his extraordinary
    ability to advance science in this important area, as evidenced by his
    excellent publication record in the field and citations by scientific
    community outside his collaborators and superiors.” (Exhibit 13)<o:p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">Prof. Jason Beres, the
    Director of the Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC) at the
    University of California, Irvine, highlighted the results of my research
    work in his reference letter: “In this excellent research, Dr. Silva
    developed an improved scheme to identify and map out global rainfall and its
    intensity. Because of his outstanding and original scientific contribution,
    NOAA now can produce rainfall products for 24 hours/day and 7 days/week
    operational from the AMSU sensors on all of the above referenced satellites.
    This is very important for the continuous monitoring of rainfall systems
    which impact the United States greatly, and can prevent considerable loss of
    life and property damage. For example, Hurricane Katrina in 2009 resulted in
    $81.2 billion in damages and killed at least 1,836 people. Dr. Silva’s
    work is critical for detecting and monitoring the rainfall associated with
    such hurricanes that can potentially affect the United States.” (Exhibit

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">In summary, the scope of
    my research work, the recommendation letters from experts in my field, and
    my published research papers and citations clearly establishes that my
    original scientific contributions are of major significance to the
    atmospheric research field. It is also obvious that my work has earned me an
    international reputation and recognition in the satellite meteorology

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">As described in the
    previous section, my research projects have strong links with the mentioned
    challenges. In order to develop those research activities, I was awarded
    with two different grants as a Principal Investigator (PI) based on my
    previous academic contributions in the field:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">NOAA/NESDIS Grant

        </o:p>
        </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">These two grants were
    awarded to me as a Principal Investigator because of my outstanding record
    of authorship of scholarly articles in the field. The global observation of
    precipitation on a wide range of time and space scales is essential to
    achieving NOAA’s mission objectives related to the monitoring and
    prediction of weather, climate changes, and many aspects of hydrologic
    monitoring and prediction. Because the precipitation is a key variable in
    many NOAA missions from ecosystems vulnerability to commerce and
    transportation, the production and archiving activities associated with
    precipitation data are carried out in multiple centers across the United
    States.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">These two projects are
    also in accordance with the goals established by NOAA’s Cooperative
    Institute for Climate and Satellites (CICS) for global observation of
    precipitation on a wide range of time and space scales. I have been working
    on these projects as a key researcher, and published three papers in
    prestigious journals so far with the grant of these two projects. (Exhibits
    8, 18, 19)<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">My productivity and the
    importance of my research works are noted by several professors and experts
    in their recommendation letters written on my behalf. For example, Dr. Tommy
    Mayo, a senior researcher at NOAA’s Cooperative Institute for Climate and
    Satellites, wrote that “For the first time, Dr. Silva pioneered a
    technique that allows storm clouds to be monitored anywhere in the world
    where geostationary satellite data exist. In the United States, this unique
    technique complements existing technologies that use radar data, and could
    be especially useful in mountainous regions in the western states where
    radar data are known to have problems, or for storms that develop offshore
    out of radar range. Dr. Silva’s outstanding research results have been
    published in several prestigious journals in the field, such as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">International Journal of Remote Sensing, International Journal of
    Meteorology, Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">NOAA
    Technical Report.</i>” (Exhibit 10)<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">As a principal research
    scientist at the MIT’s Center for Global Change Science, Dr. Lee Pender
    wrote in his recommendation letter that “As an outstanding scientist in
    the Atmospheric Science, Dr. Silva has published a number of articles in
    leading journals providing expert opinions, judgments, and detailed
    description of experimental methods to the field. For example, he published
    several articles in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">International
    Journal of Meteorology</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">International
    Journal of Remote Sensing</i>, which are the most important journals in the
    field.” Dr. Pender also stated that “Dr. Silva’s admission and ability
    to work permanently in the United States will be greatly beneficial to the
    fundamental research on the remote sensing of precipitation programs within
    the United States. The work that Dr. Silva finished has very high quality
    and his extensive experience in the field will benefit the U.S. greatly in
    the future.” (Exhibit 9)<o:p>

    of World Meteorological Organization (WMO). This group focuses the
    scientific community on operational and research satellite based
    quantitative precipitation research. The International Precipitation Working
    Group provides a forum for operational and research users of satellite
    precipitation measurements to exchange information on methods for measuring
    precipitation and the impact of space borne precipitation measurements in
    numerical weather and hydrometeorological prediction and climate studies. <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">The objectives of the

    standards for validation and independent verification of precipitation
    measurements derived from satellite data; validation of precipitation for
    weather, application of standard analysis techniques that quantify the
    uncertainty of ground-based measurements over relevant time. The IPWG
    invited me to participate in activities of this group as an expert, based on
    my original scientific and scholarly research contributions in the field.

    and it requires experience reflecting professional maturity and significant
    professional achievements. To be eligible for the senior member grade, a
    candidate must be a scientist or a technical executive in an IPWG-designated
    field, and show &quot;significant performance&quot; over a period of at
    least eight years in professional practice. The senior member grade requires
    outstanding professional achievements as judged by the leading experts in

    </font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font size="2" face="Arial">Every region in United
    States has different challenges to fulfill its precipitation measurement
    requirements. The rainfall satellite retrievals are absolutely necessary to
    track storm systems coming from the Pacific Ocean that affect the western
    coast; while the same tool could be applied over the tropical Atlantic Ocean
    and the Gulf of Mexico to track tropical disturbances and hurricanes that
    affect the southern U.S. and the East Coast. The lack of radar coverage and
    conventional measurements rain gauges over the mountains makes the satellite
    rainfall estimates a vital complement to get a complete picture of the
    spatial distribution of rainfall in all spatial and temporal scales over
    U.S. territory and the surrounding oceans. In addition, geostationary
    imagers can capture data at a rate that is sufficient to monitor vigorous
    convective activity in many parts of the United States.<o:p>

    presentations at the national and international conferences, and more than
    50 citations by researchers all over the world, I am highly recognized
