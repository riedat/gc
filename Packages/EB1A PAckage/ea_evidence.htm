The Evidence of a One-time Achievement&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
EB1-Extraordinary Ability is defined as <i> &quot;a level of expertise indicating
that the individual is one of a small percentage who have risen to the very top
of the field of endeavor.&quot; </i> The law requires extensive documentation to
establish eligibility. To qualify as an Alien of Extraordinary Ability, the
alien must be able to provide evidence of a one-time achievement that is a major
internationally recognized award, <a href="ea_whatis2.htm" target="_blank"><font color="#006666">or
at least three other evidences.</font></a></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Collecting evidence
is very important for EB1-Extraordinary Ability (or EB1-EA)
immigration category. It
requires you to not only provide very strong evidence, but also detailed
documentation to prove every claim that you make. You can provide &quot;evidence of a one-time achievement
(i.e. a major, internationally recognized award,&quot; which
is a very high
standard.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Certainly, If you have such an
achievement, no other evidence is
required. For artists or athletes, it may be possible (for example, an Olympic
medal). But for people working in scientific and engineering fields, there are not many such awards even
exist. An example of such an award would be the Nobel Prize in Sciences.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2.
Present Powerful Evidence - At Least Three Other Evidence</font></b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">There are two ways to satisfy the requirements for an EB1-EA immigrant
application. The first is receiving a major, internationally recognized award. For those who haven’t won the Nobel
Prize or other major awards, the second set of standards is not very difficult to achieve. The USCIS regulations require that an
alien applicant fulfills at least three of the following ten
standards. Here, meeting three
criteria is the
minimum requirement. You should present strong evidence for at least three to
consider your chance of succeeding in EB1-Extraordinary Ability category.<o:p>

            c) The number of awardees or prize recipients as well as any limitations on competitors (an award limited to competitors from a single institution, for example, may have little national or international significance).</font></li>

could include a fellowship, or a competitive assistantship, such as </span>a Fulbright award or a
medical
fellowship. An award does not have to be in the United States. Many countries have science and
technology invention awards, education excellence awards, etc. Be sure to include
evidence or documents that indicate and explain that the award is a major award.
For it to be considered to be a strong evidence, you have to provide information
as to what organization has presented this award, and what is the standing of
that organization in your field of endeavor. Awards from the government of a
country will have a higher standing. Also, you need to provide information as to
how many people you competed against, and what category you got the award
in.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Example could be best paper awards in a
conference, and the standing of the conference in a field will determine if that evidence is strong
or not. For example, if you got an award in an IEEE International conference,
then the evidence would be strong. But if you got the award in a regional/school conference, then it may be a weaker evidence. Patent
awards can also be listed. For this, the patent review documents and application
documents should be attached. You can present patent
awards to supplement your list of
awards, but you cannot rely on patents alone to qualify as evidence towards this
criterion.<o:p>

</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Membership in
associations in the field which require outstanding achievements
as judged by recognized national or international experts<o:p></font></b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The USCIS
adjudicator will determine if the association for which the alien claims membership requires that members have outstanding achievements in the field as judged by recognized experts in that field.<br>
<br>
The petitioner must show that membership in the associations is based on the alien being judged by recognized national or international experts as having attained outstanding achievements in the field for which classification is sought. For example, admission to membership in the National Academy of Sciences as a Foreign Associate requires individuals to be nominated by an academy member, and membership is ultimately granted based upon recognition of the individual’s distinguished achievements in original research.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Associations may have multiple levels of membership. The level of membership afforded to the alien must show that in order to obtain that level of membership, the alien was judged by recognized national or international experts as having attained outstanding achievements in the field for which classification is sought.<br>
<br>
Relevant factors that may lead to a conclusion that the alien’s membership in the associations was not based on outstanding achievements in the field include, but are not limited to, instances where the alien’s membership was based:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Solely on a level of education or years of experience in a particular
            field;</font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">On the payment of a fee or by subscribing to an association’s publications; or</font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">On a requirement, compulsory or otherwise, for employment in certain occupations, such as union membership or guild affiliation for actors.</font></li>
        </ul>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial"> Associations that are open to all members of a given profession can be considered, but associations that limit membership to only the most accomplished members of the profession are certainly more valuable.
Collecting evidence for this criterion is somewhat
questionable to present strong evidence towards this criterion. For example, a
membership in IEEE
might have been considered strong evidence previously. But some USCIS Service
Center issued letters of Request For Evidence (RFE) stating they would not accept this as strong evidence, because it
shows that many new members were added every year, and it does not show if you are
outstanding in your field.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The membership of professional organizations may not be considered as evidence towards this
criterion unless you can reach a senior or top level, to which
people are nominated based on their achievements and through an election
process. If you do present this kind of evidence, you have to attach details of
what are the nomination criteria for this membership and accompanying review or
recommendation
letters for this evidence to be considered. You can get these letters from the
review committee by requesting them, even if they do not issue them normally.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">3) Published

            sought. The published material should be about the alien relating to his or her work in the field, not just about his or her employer or another organization that he or she is associated with. Note that marketing materials created for the purpose of selling the alien’s products or promoting his or her services are not generally considered to be published material about the beneficiary.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Determine whether the publication qualifies as a professional publication or major trade publication or a major media
            publication: Evidence of published material in professional or major trade publications or in other major media publications about the alien should establish that the circulation (on-line or in print) is high compared to other circulation statistics and show who the intended audience of the publication is, as well as the title, date and author of the material.</font></li>
        </ul>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The material must concern your work in the field. Publications could range from journals specific to your field, like
<i> The Journal of Otolaryngology</i>, to major newspapers, like <i> The New York
Times</i>. You are not limited to printed media; a story about you on &quot;<i>60
Minutes</i>&quot; might also fulfill this requirement. Basically, any published materials that
specifically introduce your work can be used. The publication has to
specifically discuss your work and its importance. Whether the evidence is
strong or weak will depend upon where the material was published, or which media
it was shown on. For example, if CBS interviews you for your work for a news
report, then it will definitely be a strong evidence.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">It is also a strong
evidence if a publication of your work appears in a major trade publication showing that
your work is not just of scientific importance, but also has practical
application in industry. But if a report about your work is published just in
your school magazine, then it may or may not be considered as a strong evidence.
However, you should not hesitate to give whatever evidence you have. Remember, the
criterion requires that the publication is about you and your work. It might be
due to your work that you got a report published about you.<o:p>
</o:p>
 Therefore, the citations about your research work are clearly not enough to
satisfy this criterion.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">If your evidence is
weak, and you are solely relying on it to make the minimum requirements, then
you may get a RFE (Request For Evidence) letter from USCIS Service Center later,
and you will have to reply to the RFE questions. So, you should remember to provide as much
information as you can about the media and trade publication that your work was
published in, and its standing.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The USCIS
adjudicator will determine whether the alien has acted as the judge of the work of others in the same or an allied field of specialization.
The petitioner must show that the alien has not only been invited to judge the work of others, but also that the alien actually participated in the judging of the work of others in the same or allied field of specialization.
For example:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Peer reviewing for a scholarly journal, as evidenced by a request from the journal to the alien to do the review, accompanied by proof that the review was actually
            completed.</font></li>
        </ul>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Sitting on the Nobel Prize Committee would fulfill the requirement, as would participating in the peer review process of a scientific article or acting as a member of a thesis review committee.
If you have participated as a referee in a professional conference, or if you are an editor of an
academic
magazine, or if you have reviewed other people's work or research, you can present
evidence for this criterion. You may also present comparable evidence if you
have participated in an interviewing panel to hire applicants for an academic
job or professional job.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">However, as an
example, even though you can mention that you have been involved in a teaching
profession where you had evaluated students for their work, this does not
constitute evidence towards this criterion. USCIS does not accept this king of evidence, and definitely not for undergraduate
students. Since the students have not become
professionals yet, and they are not your peers. Evaluating post-graduate
students, such as a PhD thesis for example, may constitute as evidence.</font></p>

For example, peer-reviewed presentations at academic symposia or peer-reviewed articles in scholarly journals that have provoked widespread commentary or received notice from others working in the field, or entries (particularly a goodly number) in a citation index which cite the alien's work as authoritative in the field, may be probative of the significance of the alien’s contributions to the field of

That said, not all expert letters provide such analysis. Letters that specifically articulate how the alien’s contributions are of major significance to the field and its impact on subsequent work add value.

original scientific work, since only then you could have received your PhD.</font></p>

Generally, a management position in a scientific organization will be a strong evidence for
this criterion. You can also play a critical role in just one department of the
organization. The impact of your work or role does not have to be organization-wide. You should keep in mind that the evidence should prove that
your role is critical, if you can prove that you are not only responsible for
your own work but also for the work of others, or in other words, in a management role. <o:p>

<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">This can also
include the establishment of a commercial company if the company is successful,
as well as other non-commercial organizations. You do not have to be the only
one to establish such an organization. If you were one of the founding members,
you can claim this criterion. As a proof towards this criterion, you can request one or more people writing
recommendation letters for you to mention this. <o:p>

or other high remuneration for services</b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The USCIS
adjudicator will determine whether the alien’s salary or remuneration is high relative to the compensation paid to others working in the field.
Evidence regarding whether the alien’s compensation is high relative to that of others working in the field may take many forms. If the petitioner is claiming to meet this criterion, then the burden is on the petitioner to provide appropriate evidence. Examples may include, but are not limited to, geographical or position-appropriate compensation surveys and organizational justifications to pay above the compensation data. Aliens working in different countries
will be evaluated based on the wage statistics or comparable evidence in that country, rather than by simply converting the salary to U.S. dollars and then viewing whether that salary would be considered high in the United States.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The regulation requires that your salary or remuneration be high in relation to others in the field, so a teacher needs not make as much as a professional football player.
The evidence in this
criterion includes the high salary, a high paid
speech, a high paid performance, or consultancy services. For higher than the average
salary, you may need to provide tax returns or payroll slips. Also,
you may need to provide a salary survey report or other such evidence which gives
average salaries in your field to compare your salary with others. Also, if
you have a higher than average salary, you can provide reference to the
survey that Department of Labor used to evaluate the Labor Certification.<o:p>

</v:shape><![endif]--><b>10) Evidence or commercial success in the performing arts, as shown by box
office receipts or record, cassette, compact disk, or video sales</b>
</font></p>


<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The USCIS
adjudicator will determine whether the alien has enjoyed commercial successes in the performing arts.
This criterion focuses on volume of sales and box office receipts as a measure of the alien’s commercial success in the performing arts. Therefore, the mere fact that an alien has recorded and released musical compilations or performed in theatrical, motion picture or television productions would be insufficient, in and of itself, to meet this criterion. The evidence must show that the volume of sales and box office receipts reflect the alien’s commercial success relative to others involved in similar pursuits in the performing arts.</font></p>


<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">This can be demonstrated by box office receipts from your films or plays, sales of your record, or selling your video documentary to a network for a notable sum.
This criterion has been defined for artists, but you may provide
comparable evidence towards this criterion for some cases. Commercial success is very important
for this type of success. You do not have to provide evidence about how you achieved
your success, but the end result is what it counts. For example, you can present evidence of sales of
the product that you developed, or the commercial success of the
technique developed by you.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">USCIS states that if the above
criteria do not readily apply to beneficiary's occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence to establish the beneficiary's eligibility. Without evidence of such a one-time achievement or three criteria demonstrating sustained acclaim, the EB1-EA
petition will likely fail.&nbsp;</font>
</p>


<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Also, technically meeting the initial evidence requirement does not guarantee that the alien will be found to be an alien of extraordinary
ability. Satisfying three out of the ten criteria does not guarantee that the USCIS will grant you EB1-EA classification as an alien of extraordinary ability. The USCIS looks for quality as well as quantity. As in
many other aspects of immigration law, comprehensive documentation of your qualifications is
very important.&nbsp;

<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3.
The Comparable Evidence to Establish the Beneficiary’s Eligibility</font></b></p>


<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">If the standards
above do not readily apply to the beneficiary’s occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence to establish the beneficiary’s eligibility.
The USCIS adjudicator will determine if the evidence submitted is comparable to the evidence required in
regulation.<br>
<br>
This regulatory provision provides petitioners the opportunity to submit comparable evidence to establish the alien beneficiary's eligibility, if it is determined that the standards described
above do not readily apply to the alien’s occupation. When evaluating such "comparable" evidence,
USCIS will consider whether the EB1-EA criteria are readily applicable to the alien’s occupation and, if not, whether the evidence provided is truly comparable to the criteria listed in that regulation.<br>
<br>
General assertions that any of the ten objective criteria described in EB1-EA do not readily apply to the alien’s occupation are not probative and
may be discounted. Similarly, claims that USCIS should accept witness letters as comparable evidence are not persuasive. The petitioner should explain why it has not submitted evidence that would satisfy at least three of the criteria set forth in
EB1-EA, as well as why the evidence it has submitted is “comparable” to that required
under EB1-EA criteria.</font></p>


<p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">On the other hand, the following are examples of where
<b>comparable evidence </b> might apply:</font></p>


      <ul>
        <li>
          <p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">An alien beneficiary who is an Olympic coach whose athlete wins an Olympic medal while under the alien’s principal tutelage would likely constitute
          comparable evidence.</font></li>
        <li>
          <p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Election to a national all-star or Olympic team might serve as comparable evidence for evidence of memberships in
          EB1-ER.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-bottom:3.75pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Note: There is no comparable evidence for the one-time achievement of a major, international recognized award.<br>
