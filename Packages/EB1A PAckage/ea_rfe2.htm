<p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">1. How to Avoid the Dreaded Request for
Evidence&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Strange as it seems, some people who qualify for temporary O-1 visas as persons of extraordinary ability do not automatically qualify for the permanent
EB1-Extraordinary Ability category, even though the standards are basically the same. It is therefore important to prepare
a Form I-140 petition for a person of extraordinary ability, according to the statutory and regulatory guidelines in order to avoid a Request for Evidence:</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Ensure that all forms are completely filled out.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
2) Clearly document in the petition cover letter about how the individual is qualified for this eminent category.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
3) Ensure that the alien meets at least three of the ten required criteria. Although meeting three of the ten criteria
would not guarantee that the alien will qualify as an individual of extraordinary ability in the arts, sciences, education, business or athletics. But if an alien can not satisfy at least three of these items, it may be wise to consider
other category.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
4) Clearly document through evidence that the alien qualifies for each category.
Some examples of this are:&nbsp;</font></p>

  <blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">	(i) If the alien's articles are internationally published, provide copies of the published papers and circulation information proving that the journal is internationally published;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">	(ii) If the alien has received an award, show proof of the receipt of the award and then show the criteria for the award and why it is so important in that person's field;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">	(iii) If the alien is highly paid, show that he is paid more than the weighted average, by showing copies of salary surveys for that particular position.&nbsp;</font></p>

  </blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5) If this is an employer sponsored petition, document the employer's ability to pay through:</font></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">	Copies of Signed Corporate Federal Tax Returns;</font></li>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"> 	Copies of Audited Financial Statements; or&nbsp;</font></li>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">	If the company has over 100 employees, provide a signed statement from the Chief Financial Offer (not the Human Resources Department) documenting the
      petitioner's ability to pay.&nbsp;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">6) If this is a self-petition and
  without a job currently, document the following to demonstrate how the alien intends to support himself/herself through:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Offer of Employment or Contract;</font></li>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Proof of Current Assets&nbsp;</font></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Remember that the USCIS will not approve an
EB1-EA petition simply because the alien meets three of the ten criteria. An individual of extraordinary ability
must be one who belongs to that "small percentage" who has "risen to the very top of the field of endeavor".&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. What You
  Should Do After Receiving the RFE</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">When your petition can not be immediately
adjudicated, a request for additional evidence will be sent to you.
During the
response time period, you may:</font>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">submit all of the requested
    evidence,</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">submit some or none of the
    requested evidence and ask for a decision based upon the record, or</font><font SIZE="2"></li>
    </ul>

<ul>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">withdraw the petition.</font><font SIZE="2"></li>
  </ul>
</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">If a correction is needed to the
petition, a photocopy of the form will be included with the Request for
Evidence. The correction can be made on the photocopy and then will
be included in the formal USCIS file of your case.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">NO extension of the
response time is possible. Please also note that NO interim benefits will be
granted during the time waiting for additional evidence to be submitted. If a
response is not received within the time limit, the case will be considered
abandoned and denied; the denial may not be appealed. </font></p>
<p align="left"><u><font size="2" face="Arial">It is extremely important that
the letter requesting evidence be returned with the evidence and that the
special mailing envelope provided be used. Failure to do so will delay
processing of the case and may result in a denial due to abandonment.</font></u></p>
<p align="left"><u><font size="2" face="Arial">Evidence submitted without the
letter and/or proper return mailing envelope will be difficult to match up with
the pending case and may be treated as general correspondence.</font></u></p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3. The Tips for
the Request&nbsp;For Evidence</font></b>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The following are tips on I-140 RFEs
issued by the USCIS:</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">1) RFE
  Response Deadline:</font> With rare exceptions, the USCIS normally allows more
  than 30 days from the date the RFE is issued for the petitioner to respond.
  More importantly, it does not permit any time extensions. A RFE due date is
  fixed, and there are no exceptions to this rule. If a petitioner fails to
  respond to a RFE in time, the USCIS will usually deny the petition as
  &quot;abandoned.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#006666">2) Never Receive the RFE:</font> Although it is standard
  practice for the USCIS to send an I-140 RFE to the petitioner, sometimes the
  petitioner never receives the RFE. The first indication of a problem then
  occurs when the petitioner receives a Denial Notice directly. In this case,
  the petitioner can request the USCIS to reopen the case because RFE was never
  received - <i>documentary proof of non-receipt is not possible</i>. The USCIS
  has reopened I-140 cases where the petitioner has, in a timely manner,
  reported the problem to USCIS.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#006666">3) Sign up with the USCIS Case Status Service:</font> In
  order to avoid non-receipt of RFEs, the petitioner should sign up with the <i><b>USCIS
  Case Status Service</b></i> for email notification on petition status for the
  I-140 filed. When an RFE is issued, the online status message will be changed
  to reflect this event, and an email will automatically be sent to the
  petitioner.</font>
