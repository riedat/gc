    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Subject: Dr. Itzhak Sonakar's Form I-140 Immigrant Petition
    for First Preference Priority Workers - EB1-Extraordinary Ability</font>
  </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">To Whom It May Concern:</font>
  </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This letter is submitted in support of Dr.
    Itzhak Sonakar's petition for permanent resident status in the United States. It is my professional opinion that
    his admission and ability to work permanently in the United States will be greatly beneficial to the fundamental research on the specialized military communication
    microphones and mechatronics systems of United States.  Considering his qualifications,
    he certainly has proven himself to be an outstanding researcher with extraordinary
    ability in science and engineering.<br>
    <br>
    As a full professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of
    Pennsylvania, I am considered as an expert in the field of systems, design, and manufacturing, especially in the areas of smart materials and mechatronics research and design. I have authored and coauthored over 75 full length technical articles, edited three books and
    hold six patents
    as well.<br>
    <br>
    Currently, Dr. Sonakar is a research scientist in Dynamic Energy Technologies, Inc.,
    which is a large military technology research company. He is working on a DARPA
    (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) funded scientific research project which will bring revolutionary advances in communication
    within the noisy environments. In his current position as a Principal Investigator of the DARPA
    funded project, Dr. Sonakar has contributed significantly to the development of a new technology
    <i>“Intra-oral Bone Conduction Microphone”</i> for use in noisy military environment.&nbsp;</font>
  </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The speech recognition devices such as Phraselator
    currently use conventional air conduction microphones. The Phraselator is a voice-activated handheld system that translates predetermined phrases into the desired foreign language, allowing users to accurately convey critical information in
    real-time, without a human translator.  It is currently used by U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq.  When the soldier speaks to the built-in microphone of the Phraselator in English, the Phraselator using built-in automatic speech recognition and language
    translator is able to play the phrase in Pashto or Arabic, with background noise.</font>
  </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The team headed by Dr. Sonakar addressed this
    issue by completely eliminating the effect of background noise - extracting the spoken sounds from the bone conducted vibrations.
    The DARPA selected Dr. Sonakar’s research proposal among many highly competitive bidders that was solicited to solve the problems present in the Phraselators used by the
    U.S. Army personnel.  With the DARPAs’ funding of the SBIR project entitled
    <i> “Alternative Transducers for hand held device in noisy military environment”,</i> Dr.
    Sonakar and his research team conducted extensive research and development work that has resulted in the ground-breaking “intra-oral bone conduction
    microphone,” which can sense the vibrations of the teeth and interpret it as the spoken sound.  Since the background noise does not set up vibration in the human bone similar to the vibration induced by speaking, this novel method eliminates the background noise at its source.&nbsp;</font>
  </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This research result is of considerable importance to the United States, as
    the bone conduction technology shall significantly improve the communication in noisy environments.
    The bone conduction microphone is expected to benefit many U.S. government agencies such as DOD, NASA, Coast
    Guard, FAA, FEMA, and Department of Transportation to name a few.
    Other notable beneficiaries include personnel from law enforcement agencies.&nbsp;</font>
  </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Sonakar has published numerous original
    papers in the field of speech recognition technologies, most of them in
    journals with international circulation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>All
    of these papers were selected for publication through a critical peer review
    process. Although most of  Dr. Sonakar’s papers were published in highly
    ranked scientific journals, it is significant to note that one of his
    articles was published in the journal <i>Science</i>, which is generally
    considered to be one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the
    world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Papers published in this
    journal are recognized by the scientific editors and reviewers as being of
    exceptional significance and of great interest to a wide range of
    scientists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Consequently, this
    journal publishes only a very small fraction of the manuscripts submitted to
    it for consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>Furthermore,  Dr. Sonakar’s publication in <i>Science </i>was
    chosen by the Language Technology Society as the <i>“most
    significant paper of the year.”</i></font>
  </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Also, Dr. Sonakar has made significant contributions to the study of Magnetostrictive smart sensor materials and their use in health monitoring of structures.  Dr.
    Sonakar developed nonlinear mathematical model based algorithms that makes the on-site and in-field inspection of aircraft structures practical and economical.
    The health monitoring of aging aircraft structures, especially in military service, is a pressing need since the failure is typically sudden and catastrophic.  Many
    researcher have developed various methods for inspection of aircraft structural parts.  However, typically these methods require disassembly of the aircraft parts and hence have not been widely used.  The use of magnetostrictive particle
    sensors designed by Dr. Sonakar provides a unique solution that does not require disassembly.&nbsp;</font>
  </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Dr. Sonakar's novel and creative research on magnetostrictive smart sensors proved that it is possible to inspect and detect damage at its initial stages,
    using nonlinear mathematical model based algorithms.  Magnetostrictive particles, one of the new type of smart material, are
    nonlinear and hence require a good understanding of its behavior, before it can be used in applications relevant to civil and military structural health monitoring.&nbsp;</font>
  </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Several of Dr. Sonakar’s papers on magnetostrictive smart sensors
    were published in journals sponsored by the IEEE.  Two of these papers were published in the
    <i> Journal of Smart Material Technology</i>, where only studies of general
    scientific interest are being published. Dr. Sonakar has been extremely successful in publishing the results of his research in the most prestigious scientific journals.  The impact of his publications on the international scientific community has been
    substantial, and the significance of his contributions is also evident by the fact that his work
    has been cited in more than 100 publications written by others, a number that is increasing
    steadily.&nbsp;</font>
  </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">  All of the above is a clear indication of Dr.
    Sonakar ’s status as an outstanding academic researcher with extraordinary
    ability in scientific research. Dr. Sonakar’s scientific contribution in
    the field can also be seen from a number of national and international conferences in which
    he was invited to present his findings. Getting the invitation to speak in front of hundreds of national and international experts in
    a scientific field is not only a big honor, but also a recognition of the quality of
    his research by well known researchers in the world.</font>
  </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Sonakar brings a unique blend of talents to
    his research endeavor, and he should be able to continue to contribute greatly and uniquely to the national interest of
    Unites States. Dr. Sonakar is an asset to the scientific community and to the United States.  I support his application for permanent resident status enthusiastically and without reservation, and urge you to approve his petition
    as First Preference Priority Worker in the EB1-Extraordinary Ability category.</font>
