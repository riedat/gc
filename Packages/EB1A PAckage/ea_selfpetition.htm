    <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">1. The Self-petitioning for
EB1-Extraordinary Ability</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The self-petitioning for EB1-Extraordinary Ability
is a very important part of U.S. Green Card application. The
self-petitioning for EB1-Extraordinary Ability (EB-1A) does not necessarily refer to filing an application without
any help from your employer, but it refers to filing a Form I-140 petition in the EB1-Extraordinary Ability
category by yourself as both the petitioner and the beneficiary.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">  Most self-petitioners need help from their
employers to prepare the required documents, and many employers
provide such support for document collection for self-petitioners. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
    Services (USCIS) Form I-140
is used for employment based Green Card applications and for EB1-Extraordinary Ability application. The EB1-Extraordinary Ability
application can be filed without a job offer, which still falls under the employment based
immigration application.<br>
<br>
If you are considering applying for a Green Card in the EB1 category, you should
know the advantage of self-petitioning
for EB1-Extraordinary Ability and the disadvantage of employer-based petitioning.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666"><b>2. The Self-Petition and
&quot;Continue to Work in the Area of Expertise in U.S.&quot;</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">An Form I-140 application filed for an alien of extraordinary ability does not need to be supported by a job offer or be sponsored by an U.S.
    employer, and the alien applicant can self-petition for the EB-1A application. For a self-petitioned EB-1A application, the alien applicant must demonstrate that
    he or she will continue to work in the field of extraordinary ability in the United States, and the alien applicant's work should benefit the United
    States substantially.<br>
    <br>
    There are no standard criteria for what will substantially benefit the United States. In
    the EB-1A applications, the petitioner must show that the alien will continue to work in the area of expertise in the United States. If USCIS adjudicators are not satisfied that the
    alien applicant has satisfied the requirements, a Request For Evidence (RFE) notice may be issued by
USCIS.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><u><b><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Example for Athletes
  and Coaches: </font> </i></b></u><font face="Arial" size="2">There are cases where it is difficult to determine if an
  applicant's intended employment is in the area of extraordinary ability. Some of the cases are those where the
  alien applicant’s sustained national or international acclaim is based on the abilities as an athlete, but the alien’s intent is to come to U.S. to be employed as an athletic coach or manager.</font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We all know that competitive athletics and coaching have different sets of skills, and
  therefore are not in the same area of expertise. But on the other hand, many extraordinary athletes have become extraordinary coaches later.&nbsp;</font></p>

  <ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">If an alien athlete has achieved national or international acclaim, and has sustained that acclaim in coaching or management field at a national level, USCIS may consider the evidence as establishing an overall pattern of sustained acclaim and extraordinary ability, and then may conclude that coaching is in the beneficiary’s area of
      expertise.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">If a beneficiary has an extended period of time to establish the reputation as a coach, beyond the years as an athlete and with the specific facts, USCIS may consider
      the evidence of the alien applicant’s acclaim as a coach or a manager.</font></li>
  </ul>

    <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3. The Advantage of Self-petitioning
for U.S. Green Card in the Category of EB1-Extraordinary Ability</font></b></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) You are the person to choose your U.S.
    immigration category, not your employer or a lawyer. By choosing the EB1-Extraordinary Ability
    category, you can save time by bypassing the long-time process of
    Labor Certification. Since the EB1-Extraordinary Ability application cuts down
the requirement to obtain Labor Certification from U.S. Department of Labor, the path to
receive a Green Card is shorter, and you do not have to have a job offer of a
permanent position from an
    U.S. employer. In many cases, U.S. Department of Labor turned down a Labor
Certification application because the alien failed to convince the Department why the employer was not able to hire someone from
the local candidates, when many U.S. citizens are available in the labor market.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) The application in the EB1-Extraordinary Ability
category gives you a flexibility and option to move around different U.S.
employers. You have freedom to change to different
    employers. You do not need to stay with your current employer during the entire
Green Card application process, and this advantage gives you a leverage which most immigrants
do not have. For immigration petitions based on Labor
Certification, an alien has to stay with the petitioning employer for the entire
Green Card application process, in some cases, which means working for an
employer without a pay-raise, or even have to take pay-cuts because the alien
applicant does not have other choice.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">3) Because an EB1-Extraordinary Ability petition does not depend on your
    current employer, if you change job or get layoff, you will not lose your chance
    of obtaining a Green Card, and your petition case is still valid. Since you
do not have to work for the same employer, it is safer for you to survive the
possible company layoff or economic downturn. Even if you change employer or are laid off
and cannot find work temporarily, it does not affect your EB1-Extraordinary Ability
application.&nbsp;</font></p>

</blockquote>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
The other advantages of the self-petitioning for EB1-Extraordinary Ability include:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You have the ability to avoid dependence on an employer
    or a lawyer;&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You control your Green Card application case
    and process, and it is not controlled by your employer or a lawyer;</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You do not have to have a job offer from a
    U.S. employer for the EB1-Extraordinary Ability application;</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Save a lot of money as compared with hiring a
    lawyer.</font></li>
</ul>
    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#006666">4. The Disadvantage of
Employer-based Petition</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The employers who file Green Card
    applications for the alien employees often provide support for document collection.  However, the employers
often pick the easy pass for them, and go through the lengthy Labor
Certification process. Thus, it slows down the entire Green Card application process, and sometimes it
become impossible to obtain a Green Card in years, due to the the alien's visa time
restriction or the unavailability of an immigration visa number.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Another disadvantage of employer-based petition is that many employers will use their own attorney.
Most of these company hired attorneys are good at business law, but not at the immigration
law. Therefore, the company hired attorneys may concentrate on temporary visas, such as
H-1B visa in most cases, or a simpler Labor Certification process. Since EB1-Extraordinary Ability
is unfamiliar and complex to them, they simply do not want to
spend too much time on it. In other words, most of the company hired attorneys
are general practice lawyers, not attorneys specialized in complicated Green
Card
applications, like EB1-Extraordinary Ability.
</font></p>
    <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">5. The Disadvantages of
    Hiring a Lawyer by Yourself</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In fact, there are not many people have good
    experiences with attorneys during their applications of Green Cards. If you
    are going to apply for Green Card based on the EB1-Extraordinary Ability by
    hiring a lawyer, you need to spend at least $4,000 (the normal range is
    about $4000 to $8000) for the attorney fee, which does not even include the
    application fees to USCIS. During the application process, most likely you
    will completely lost the control as to how fast you would like the process
    to go, once the contract has been signed and the payment has been made to
    the lawyer.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After you signed the contract, your attorney
    normally may tell where to find related information, email you forms for
    Green Card application, give you 2-3 sample letters of recommendation to
    follow, and may also give you a to-do list. After months of you hard work,
    finally the attorney will construct a Form I-140 petition cover letter for
    you, based on all the documents and reference letters that you provided. You
    need to remember that an attorney may has hundreds of cases to deal with at
    the same time. So, he or she has to be fair to every client, and could not
    spend too much time on your case at the expenses of others.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Although an attorney may promise that your
    process would depend on how well you prepare the documents, but he or she
    may keep to convince you that your case is not strong enough, even though
    you may have more than ten articles published in academic journals and two
    patents pending. In fact, there is nothing you really could do, since the
    contract may say very clearly <i>“No guarantee has been made as to the
    time this case will take, neither to the successful outcome of this case.”</i></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Therefore, if you know that you have to go
    through the process all by yourself, you may better do it on your own at the
    first place. On the other hand, you should not blame the lawyers for what
    they are doing, because they can not possibly know all the technical details
    which are of U.S. National Interest in your specific research and some
    specific evidence which could be critical to your case.</font></p>
    <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">6. How to Self-petition
    Your EB1-Extraordinary Ability Case</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In an EB1-Extraordinary Ability petition, the emphasis is laid on
your personal achievements in a field, and to prove that you are at the top of a
field. A right approach to define your field and provide evidence for the achievements is the key in a successful EB1-Extraordinary Ability
petition.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As a self-petitioner, you should evaluate your situation as to the options of immigration petition. You may first update your resume and then consider whether the
EB-1A category is applicable to your situation. If not, you may consider other immigration classifications
which may be best for you, such as Outstanding Researcher or Professor
(EB-1B), National Interest Waiver (NIW) or even Labor Certification.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After you choose the EB1-Extraordinary Ability
classification, you need:</font></p>

    <blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) effectively communicate with your current employer
and/or previous employer to obtain any help for document/evidence collection for your achievements in a field;
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) carefully examine the sample recommendation letters provided in
this package, which can be used as a reference for the initial draft of the Letters of
Recommendation (or reference letters) for your petition;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">3) review and edit your draft letters of recommendation to ensure that they include the appropriate language and meet the
EB-1A requirements;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">4) collect all the documents and evidence needed for your EB-1A petition;<br>
<br>
5) organize all the required documentation for your EB-1A petition, including the signed
reference letters;<br>
<br>
6) draft a petition cover letter based on the sample cover letter included in
this package, which explains in detail how you should qualify as an Alien of Extraordinary Ability;<br>
<br>
7) fill and sign the Form I-140, and submit the completed petition materials to
a proper USCIS Service Center, with the required application fee;<br>
<br>
8) contact the USCIS for the status inquiry of your pending case;<br>
<br>
9) if the USCIS makes a request for additional evidence on your pending case, you should respond and submit the additional documentation required for your case to the USCIS in time.&nbsp;</font></p>
