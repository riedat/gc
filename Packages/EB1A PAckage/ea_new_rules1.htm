of &quot;Two-Part
Evaluation&quot; for EB1-Extraordinary Ability Petition</font></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">On August 18, 2010, U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a Policy Memorandum to provides guidance regarding the analysis that Immigration Service Officers
(ISOs) must use in adjudicating Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker,
filed for:</font></p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"><font size="2" face="Arial">EB1-Extraordinary Ability;</font></li>

    of Exceptional Ability, including EB2 National Interest Waiver (NIW).</font></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The purpose of the Policy Memorandum
is to
ensure that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) processes Form
I-140 petitions filed under these employment-based immigrant classifications
with a consistent standard. USCIS Immigration Service Officers will follow the amended procedures in the adjudication of all Form I-140 petitions filed for
EB1-Aliens
of Extraordinary Ability. In general, the petition must be accompanied by initial
evidence that:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">a) the alien has sustained national or international acclaim;
and&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">b) the alien’s achievements have been recognized in the field of
expertise.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"> This initial evidence must include either evidence of a one-time
achievement (i.e., a major international recognized award, such as the Nobel
Prize), or at least three of the ten types of evidence. ISOs
must use a <b><i> two-part analysis</i></b> to determine eligibility First, the ISO must determine if the petitioner has, by a preponderance
of the evidence, met at least three of the criteria, and then the ISO should
consider all of the evidence in totality in making the <b><i> final merits
determination</i></b>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">To evaluate whether the
evidence provided meets at least three criteria, ISOs must determine whether the
petition is supported by evidence of a one-time achievement (that is, a major,
internationally recognized award). If it is not, then they must make a
determination that is limited to whether the evidence submitted in the petition
meets at least three criteria as discussed above.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2. USCIS' Policy Memorandum
for EB1 and EB2 Adjudication</font></b></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The USCIS interim memo entitled,
      <b> Evaluation of Evidentiary Criteria in Certain I-140 Petitions,</b> provides instructions to USCIS adjudicators of Extraordinary Ability, Outstanding Professor or Researcher, and
      EB2 Exceptional Ability I-140 petitions. This interim memo outlines a two-step adjudication analysis based on the decision by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Kazarian v. USCIS. The interim memo is
      currently is governing the adjudication of the affected types of petitions.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The interim memo instructs USCIS adjudicators to use an approach to evidence evaluation referenced in the Kazarian case. This review consists of a "two-part approach where the evidence is first counted and then considered in the context of a final merits determination."
The purpose of the Policy Memorandum
is to
ensure that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) processes Form
I-140 petitions filed under these employment-based immigrant classifications
with a consistent standard.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Meeting the minimum requirement of providing evidence relating to
at least three criteria does not, in itself, establish that the alien in fact
meets the requirements for classification as an Alien of Extraordinary Ability. In making this determination, the quality of the evidence, such as whether the
judging responsibilities were internal and whether the scholarly articles (if
pertinent to the occupation) are cited, is an appropriate consideration in the
final merits determination.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> In addition, the alien’s
performance at the so-called major-league level does not automatically establish
that he or she meets the extraordinary ability standards. Also, U.S. Congress
intended that in the absence of a one-time achievement, an alien could qualify
for the classification based on a “career of acclaimed work.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">In Part Two of the analysis in
each case, ISOs will consider all of the evidence to make a final merit
determination of whether or not the petitioner, by a preponderance of the
evidence, has demonstrated that the alien has:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) <i> A level of expertise
indicating that the individual is “one of that small percentage who have risen
to the very top of the field of endeavor.” and</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) <i> Sustained national or
international acclaim and that his or her achievements have been recognized in
the field of expertise.</i></font></p>
        </blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The EB1-Extraordinary Ability
and EB1-Outstanding Researcher or Processor categories have high standards for successfully obtaining approval. These two EB1 categories have become even more difficult, in large part due to a change in the way supporting evidence is analyzed by the USCIS. An explanation of the
approach is set forth in an April 18, 2010 USCIS memorandum, relying on a case entitled Kazarian v. USCIS.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3. Background
Information for USCIS' Guidance of Adjudicating Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien
Worker</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">USCIS has consistently
recognized that Congress intended to <u> set a very high standard for individuals
seeking immigrant visas as aliens of extraordinary ability.</u> In order to qualify
for admission in this category, an alien must, among other things, demonstrate
sustained national or international acclaim in the alien’s field of endeavor. Qualification under this category is
reserved for the small percentage of individuals at the very top of their fields
of endeavor.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">An alien
can establish sustained national or international acclaim through evidence of a
one-time achievement (that is, a major, internationally recognized award).
Barring the alien’s receipt of such an award, the regulation outlines ten
criteria, at least three of which must be satisfied for an alien to establish
the sustained acclaim necessary to qualify as an alien of extraordinary ability.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">In 2010, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reviewed the USCIS appellate
decision on a petition filed under this classification. Kazarian v. USCIS. Although the court
upheld the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO)’s decision to dismiss the
appeal, the court took issue with the AAO’s evaluation of evidence submitted
to meet a given evidentiary criterion. Specifically, the court stated that AAO
had imposed requirements beyond those set forth in the regulations.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">With respect to the criteria at
8 CFR 204.5(h)(3)(iv) (“evidence of the alien's participation, either
individually or on a panel, as a judge of the work of others in the same or an
allied field of specialization for which classification is sought”) and (vi)
(“evidence of the alien's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in
professional or major trade publications or other major media”), the court
concluded that while USCIS may have raised legitimate concerns about the
significance of the evidence submitted to meet those two criteria, those
concerns should have been raised in a subsequent “<b><i>final merits
determination</i></b>.” Thus, the Kazarian decision sets forth a two-part approach
where the evidence is first counted and then considered in the context of a
final merits determination.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The analysis used by USCIS in reviewing evidence provided in support of Outstanding Professor or
Researcher petitions and Alien of Exceptional Ability petitions also involves an
evaluation of lists of regulatory criteria.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">4. The
USCIS' Two-Part Approach for Form I-140 Adjudication</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">In order to promote consistency
in decision-making, ISOs will use the two-part approach set forth in the
Kazarian decision for all petitions filed for Aliens of Extraordinary Ability,
for Outstanding Professors or Researchers, or for Aliens of Exceptional Ability
(including EB2 National Interest Waiver (NIW)).
The ISO must first evaluate the evidence on an individual basis to determine if
it meets the criteria, and then must consider all of the evidence in totality in
making the final merits determination.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
standard of proof applied for petitions filed for Aliens of Extraordinary
Ability, for Outstanding Professors or Researchers, or for Aliens of Exceptional
Ability is the “preponderance of the evidence” standard. Thus, if the
petitioner submits relevant, probative, and credible evidence that leads USCIS
to believe that the claim is true “more likely than not,” the applicant or
petitioner has satisfied the standard of proof.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">If a petitioner provides
supporting documentation that satisfies the regulatory prongs, and such
documentation is legitimate (i.e. not forged, issued in error, inaccurate,
etc.), an adjudicator will first determine whether the petitioner has
provided evidence to satisfy the requisite number of evidentiary prongs under
the particular EB-1 classification. The adjudicator must look at each prong for
which evidence has been provided (“the proper procedure is to count the types
of evidence provided”) to determine how many evidentiary prongs have been
satisfied.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"> If the documentation (including but not limited to articles,
publications, memos, reference letters, expert testimony, support letters, etc.)
is relevant to the category, is substantive (does not merely recite the
regulations) and is credible, then it will be suffices. Once USCIS determines
that the petitioner has provided satisfactory evidence for the requisite number
of prongs, the second phase of review requires the adjudicator to weigh the
evidence against the required high level of expertise for the visa category. It
is in the second phase of the review where the evidence can be evaluated to see
if, cumulatively, it proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the
applicant or beneficiary is at the very top of his or her field of endeavor.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Therefore, ISOs
must use a two-part analysis to determine eligibility First, the ISO must determine if the petitioner has, by a preponderance
of the evidence, met the required criteria, and then the ISO should
consider all of the evidence in totality in making the final merits
determination.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">5. The
“Preponderance of the Evidence” Standard of Proof&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">To keep the consistency in immigrant visa adjudication, USCIS will use two-part approach for evaluating submitted evidence for EB1 Extraordinary Ability, EB2 Outstanding Professors or Researchers, and EB2 National Interest Waiver petition.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The adjudicative officers will first evaluate each type of submitted evidence objectively to determine if it meets the regulatory criteria. The adjudicative officers then will consider all evidence in totality to make the final merits determination, for the required high level of expertise in that immigrant visa classification.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">For immigrant petitions filed for EB1 Extraordinary Ability, EB1 Outstanding Professors or Researchers, and EB2 National Interest Waiver, USCIS will use the “preponderance of the evidence” standard, which means that if the petitioner submits relevant and credible evidence that leads USCIS to believe that the claim is “more likely than not” or “probably true,” then the petitioner has satisfied the standard of proof.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
For example, if a petitioner provides evidence that is probative and credible, not merely recite the regulations, including publications, expert reference letters, employer support letters, then USCIS officers should evaluate the evidence objectively to determine whether or not it is acceptable, by applying the preponderance of the evidence standard.<br>
<br>
Therefore, USCIS officers should not impose novel requirements beyond those set in the regulations already, but should evaluate the submitted evidence to determine if it is in the regulations applicable to the type of evidence by a preponderance of the evidence standard. Then, USCIS officers should evaluate the evidence all together, when considering the petition case in its entirety to determine if the beneficiary has the required high level of expertise for the immigrant classification.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">6. The
Requirement of Sustained National or
International Acclaim</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">A petition for an alien of
extraordinary ability must be accompanied by evidence that the alien has
sustained national or international acclaim and that the alien's achievements
have been recognized in the field of expertise. In determining whether the
beneficiary has enjoyed “sustained&quot; national or international acclaim, such acclaim must be
      maintained. The definition of sustain is: to support
or maintain, especially over a long period of time; to persist in making an
      effort over a long period of time.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"> However, the word sustained does not
imply an age limit on the beneficiary. A beneficiary may be very young in his or
her career and still be able to show sustained acclaim. There is also no
definitive time frame on what constitutes “sustained.” If an alien was
recognized for a particular achievement, ISOs must determine whether the alien
continues to maintain a comparable level of acclaim in the field of expertise
since the alien was originally afforded that recognition. An alien may have
achieved national or international acclaim in the past but then failed to
maintain a comparable level of acclaim thereafter.</font></p>
