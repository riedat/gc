      Analysis - Alien's Receipt of Lesser Nationally or Internationally
      Recognized Prizes or Awards for Excellence in the Alien's Field&nbsp;<br>
      </font>
      </b><font size="2"><br>
      For this EB1 extraordinary ability criterion, the USCIS adjudicators' main
      focus is on the alien applicant's receipt of the award, not the employer's
      receipt of the award. Also, USCIS will determine whether the award itself
      can meet the requirement of national or international recognition for
      excellence.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      To determine the award nature, other considerations include the number of
      recipients, and if there are any regional limitations on the recipients.
      For example, if a provincial award limits competitors in one province,
      this award may not have national or international significance. The other
      consideration for nationally or internationally recognized prizes or
      awards is that awards with national recognition may be reported in the
      news paper or other media. The media reports may not focus on the alien
      applicant, but there may be some degree of national recognition of the
      award.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, USCIS believes that scholarships, fellowships and post-doc
      positions are not the &quot;nationally or internationally prizes or awards
      for excellence&quot;. Generally, these scholarships, fellowships and
      post-doc positions them self could not establish that the alien applicant
      has achieved sustained national or international recognition in the field.
      Therefore, some academic, junior athletic, or music awards would not
      satisfy this criterion also.</font></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that the award is a major, internationally recognized award includes:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) the criteria used to grant the awards;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) the national or international significance of the award in the field;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">3) the number of award recipients and limitations on

      <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">2. The EB-1A Criteria
      Analysis - Alien's Membership in Associations in the Field</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">To satisfy this EB1
      extraordinary ability criterion, the submitted evidence should establish
      that the alien applicant’s significant achievement in the field is the
      basis for the alien’s membership in the association. It is not
      sufficient for this criterion if the membership is based on education
      level, or is based on years of experience in the field.<br>
      <br>
      To satisfy this criterion, alien applicant's membership in associations
      should require outstanding achievements of their members, as judged by
      national or international experts in their fields. Also, USCIS believes
      that the membership fee payment or an association’s publication
      subscription is not sufficient for this criterion, because membership in
      some associations can be a requirement of an occupation, such as union
      membership or guild affiliation for actors.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, a compulsory membership in an association is not indicative
      of the alien applicant’s achievements in the field. Therefore, for
      example, a membership in a <i><b>State Bar</b></i>, in <b><i>American Bar
      Association (ABA)</i></b>, or in <b><i>American Immigration Lawyers
      Association (AILA) </i></b>will not be considered sufficient for this
      criterion by USCIS. Because lawyers are required to be members of a State
      Bar, most members of the bar can become ABA members, and most immigration
      lawyers could be eligible to become AILA member.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      To satisfy this criterion, the petitioner should show that the membership
      of an association is exclusive, which means that membership is limited
      only to those who have been attained outstanding achievements in the field
      as judged by their peers.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      For example, an alien’s membership in the <b><i>National Academy of
      Sciences and Engineering </i></b>would satisfy this criterion, because it
      is an honorific society, and its membership nominations are based on
      original research and accomplishment in the field, and and membership is
      granted based upon recognition of the individual’s distinguished
      achievements in original research.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Therefore, USCIS will determine if the membership association requires their members to have outstanding achievements in the field. The petitioner should show that the membership in the associations is based on the alien's outstanding achievements in the field, as judged by recognized national or international experts.<br>
      <br>
      Also, associations may have multiple levels of membership. The petitioner must show that the alien's level of membership was judged by experts as having attained outstanding achievements in the field for which levels of membership classification is sought.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The following situations may lead to USCIS to believe that an alien’s membership in the associations was not based on outstanding achievements in the field:</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) based on a level of education in a field;<br>
        <br>

        3) based on the payment of a fee;<br>
        <br>
        4) based on subscribing to an association’s publications;&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        5) based on requirement, compulsory, employment in certain occupations (such as union membership or guild affiliation for actors)</font></p>

      Trade Publications or Other Major Media</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">To satisfy this EB1
      extraordinary ability criterion, the submitted evidence should include
      published material in professional or major trade publications, or in
      major media publications, about the alien applicant's contributions to the
      field, with the circulation number and the intended audience of the
      publication. The burden is on the petitioner to establish that a
      publication is sufficient for the EB1 extraordinary ability criterion.<br>
      <br>
      For regional publications or publications for an ethnic group or language
      group, USCIS will consider them as sufficient for this criterion only if
      they are considered the top publications in the field, or the publications
      have national or international circulation and reputation. Examples of the
      qualifying regional publications include <b><i>The Wall Street Journal,</i></b>
      the <b><i>New York Times</i></b>, and the N<b><i>ew England Journal of
      Medicine.</i></b>&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      For the published material, the alien's accomplishments should be the
      focal point. Generally, it is not persuasive if articles are about the
      organizations or projects that the alien applicant is involved in, but
      only mention the alien's name in passing. The submitted evidence should
      establish the significance of the alien applicant's contributions, and
      also show that the alien is one of the small percent who have risen to the
      very top of the field.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, any marketing materials for selling the alien applicant’s
      products or promoting his/her services are not considered by USCIS to be
      published material about the alien beneficiary. Also, mere citations to an
      alien’s work, without detailed documentation establishing the alien's
      extraordinary ability in a field, are not sufficient to satisfy this
      criterion.</font></p>

      For EB1 extraordinary ability application, the submitted evidence should

      indicate the significance of the alien's experience in judging the work of
      others in the field.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      USCIS will determine if the alien applicant has acted as the judge of the
      work of others in a field of specialization. The petitioner need to show
      that the alien applicant has not only been invited to judge the work of

      this criterion, as evidenced by a request from the journal, and

      <br>
      Also, judging the a Ph.D dissertation as an external dissertation

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">To satisfy this EB1
      extraordinary ability criterion, the petitioner should provide evidence of
      the alien's &quot;original contributions of major significance&quot; to
      the field. The arguments alone are not sufficient.<br>
      <br>
      Although published work and funded research could be &quot;original
      contributions” to a field. USCIS will check if the published work and
      funded research is indeed a major, significant contribution to the field.
      USCIS will determine whether the alien has made original contributions in
      the field, and whether the alien’s original contributions are of major
      significance to the field.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      USCIS officers will evaluate whether the alien applicant's work
      constitutes major, significant contributions to the field. Although funded
      research and published work may be “original,” this fact alone is not
      sufficient to establish that the alien applicant's work has &quot;major
      significance.&quot; For example, peer-reviewed presentations or
      peer-reviewed articles in scholarly journals may have significance of the
      alien’s contributions to a field, if the presentations or articles have
      provoked widespread commentary or received a goodly number citations.<br>
      <br>
      To assist the USCIS' assessment of the alien’s original contributions in
      a field, USCIS officers will also consider the reference letters from
      experts in the fields regarding the significance of the alien’s
      contributions. But only reference letters that specifically indicate the
      alien applicant’s contributions of major significance to the field and
      its impact on subsequent work could add value for the EB-1A petition. The
      reference letters that lack specifics do not add value, and will not be

      applicant apart, as one of the small percent who has risen to the very top
      of the field.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The persuasive evidence includes the documentation that shows the
      independent experts in the field consider the published&nbsp;documents to
      be significant, or that the alien’s research results have been widely
      cited, or been widely adopted by other&nbsp;researchers or professionals.
      In the cases for scientists, this EB-1A criterion could be satisfied by
      conference presentations, if&nbsp;such evidence is indicative of the

      <br>
      As an example, peer-reviewed presentations at national or international
      conference, or peer-reviewed publications in academic&nbsp;journals that
      have received acclaim from other researchers or professionals in the
      field, may satisfy this EB-1A criterion. But an&nbsp;alien's poster or
      abstract presentation at an symposium that got little or no commentary
      from others in the field would have&nbsp;little or no value.&nbsp;<br>

      Furthermore, an alien applicant’s work, product, or publication of
      material in professional or trade publications for the employer&nbsp;or
      clients as part of the alien’s employment will not normally be
      considered to be significant to satisfy this EB-1A criterion,&nbsp;unless
      there are corroborative and independent documentary evidence.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For scholarly articles published by postdoctoral researchers, USCIS may mention a "Report and Recommendations of the Association of American Universities’ Committee on Postdoctoral Education" (March 31, 1998 ), which set definition of a postdoctoral appointment -
      <b><i> “appointment is viewed as preparatory for a full-time academic and/or research career”,</i></b> and it also indicates that
      <b><i> “the appointee has the freedom, and is expected, to publish the results of his or her research or scholarship during the period of the appointment.”
      </i></b> Therefore, USCIS and the Association of American Universities Committee on Postdoctoral Education consider a postdoctoral researcher’s academic publication to be “expected,” not always a mark of significant or distinction.</font></p>

      Analysis - Performance in a Critical or Leading Role for Organizations or
      Establishments Having a Distinguished&nbsp;Reputation<br>
      </font>
      </b><font size="2"><br>
      To meet this criterion, the submitted evidence should indicate that the
      alien applicant has performed in a leading or critical&nbsp;role in a
      distinguished organization or establishments. In other words, the provided
      evidence should establish that the alien&nbsp;applicant has played not
      just a supporting role, but the organization itself should have a
      distinguished reputation, or has hosted&nbsp;distinguished productions
      previously.<br>
      <br>
      To evaluate the submitted evidence, USCIS will examine the alien's
      position in the organization, and then determine if the alien's&nbsp;job
      is a leading or critical position, and USCIS will also determine if the
      organization itself is distinguished organization or&nbsp;establishment.
      Furthermore, USCIS will evaluate the alien's position to see if the
      alien's role was leading or critical to the entire&nbsp;organization, not
      just to a department within the organization or establishment.<br>
      <br>
      If provided documentation about the organization does not specifically
      refer to the alien's contributions, that kind of&nbsp;documentation goes
      to the reputation of the organization itself. Therefore, it is not
      persuasive evidence of the alien's&nbsp;significance of the role played in
      the organization.</font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) USCIS will determine whether the alien applicant has performed in leading or critical roles for organizations or establishments. In evaluating the submitted evidence, USCIS officers will examine if the role is leading or critical.<br>
        <br>
        For a leading role, the submitted evidence should establish that the alien applicant is a leader in an organization or establishment. A job title with appropriate position duties could establish the leading role claim.<br>
        <br>
        For a critical role, the submitted evidence should establish that the alien applicant has contributed in significant importance to an organization's activities. On the other hand, a supporting role could be considered “critical” if the alien applicant’s performance in the role is important. It is not the alien's role title, but the alien’s performance in the role that determines if the role is critical.<br>
        <br>
        Also for criterion, the reference letters from individuals with knowledge of the significance of the alien’s role can be helpful, for USCIS officers to make the determination, if the reference letters have detailed information about how the alien applicant’s role for the organization is leading or critical.<br>
        <br>
        2) USCIS will determine if the organization or establishment has a distinguished reputation.
        Generally, the relative size or longevity of an organization is not a determining factor. Rather, the organization should be recognized to have a distinguished reputation in a field.</font></p>

      for Services<br>
      </font>
      </b><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
      To satisfy this EB1 extraordinary ability criterion, the petitioner should
      show that the alien applicant has a significantly high&nbsp;salary or
      remuneration for his or her services, in relation to others in the same or
      similar field. For example, if submitted evidence shows that the alien has
      a significantly higher salary than others at the alien applicant's&nbsp;workplace,
      it may not be sufficient to establish the alien's outstanding role in the
      field, if without further and objective&nbsp;additional evidence.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Also, the submission of U.S. Department of Labor's prevailing wage
      determination or information for the alien's field may not meet&nbsp;this
      criterion, if without other corroborative evidence. Because the alien
      applicant must show that his or her salary or other&nbsp;remuneration is
      &quot;significantly&quot; higher than that of others in the field, not
      just simply higher that the &quot;prevailing wage.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      The prevailing wage information from U.S. Department of Labor should be
      accompanied by supporting documentation explaining why the&nbsp;petitioner
      believes the alien applicant's salary is significantly higher than that of
      others in the same field. If an alien&nbsp;applicant works in a foreign
      country, the wage statistics evidence should be based on that country, and
      not simply converting the&nbsp;salary to U.S. dollars and then be
      considered high in U.S.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The burden is on the petitioner to provide appropriate evidence to claim that the alien applicant could meet this criterion. The evidence may take many forms for whether the alien applicant’s compensation is higher than others working in the field. Such evidence

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) geographical compensation surveys;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) position-appropriate compensation surveys;</font></p>

      This EB1 extraordinary ability criterion focuses on the sales volume or

      <b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">11. The EB-1A Criteria Analysis - Comparable Evidence</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If the standards do not
      readily apply to the beneficiary’s occupation, the petitioner may&nbsp;submit
      comparable evidence to establish the beneficiary’s eligibility. The EB1
      extraordinary ability provision allows petitioners to submit
      &quot;comparable evidence&quot; to establish an alien applicant's&nbsp;eligibility,
      if the above 10 EB-1A criteria do not apply to the alien’s situation or
      occupation.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      To use the comparable evidence, the petitioner should explain why the
      alien applicant cannot satisfy at least 3 of the 10 EB-1A&nbsp;criteria,
      and why the submitted evidence is comparable to that required in the EB1
      extraordinary ability regulations. In some&nbsp;situations, one type of
      comparable evidence may satisfy more than one EB-1A criteria. But there is
      no comparable evidence for the&nbsp;one-time achievement of a major,
      international recognized award.<br>
      <br>
      When USCIS evaluates the submitted comparable evidence for EB1
      extraordinary ability application, they will consider if the EB-1A&nbsp;criteria
      are applicable to the alien’s occupation or situation. If not, USCIS
      will determine whether the provided evidence is&nbsp;indeed comparable to
      the 10 criteria listed in the EB-1A regulations.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">USCIS generally believe that any claim that the
      ten EB1 extraordinary ability criteria do not readily apply to an alien applicant's occupation are not probative, and may be discounted by USCIS. Also, USCIS normally will not accept reference letters as comparable evidence, because the reference letters may not be persuasive.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the following situations, the comparable evidence might apply:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) An Olympic coach whose athlete wins an Olympic medal, since the EB-1A criteria may not apply to some of athletic coaches, if coaches in their field do not typically receive nationally recognized coaching awards.<br>
      <br>
      2) A best selling author could provide evidence comparable to commercial success, even the author is not a performing artist.<br>
      <br>
      3) Election to a national all-star team could be a comparable evidence for the membership criterion.</font></p>
