Three
Criteria Applied to All Evidence</font></b><font color="#006666" size="2"><o:p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Arial" size="2">Like
in a court case, an EB1-EA petition needs to present evidence. The relevance issue
of evidence is that it should help to build an argument that
you have the mandatory level of extraordinary ability in EB1-EA. Usually, the evidence must meet
the following three criteria to be entered, and the tests should be applied to
all evidence:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">1)
The evidence must be 'Relevant'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Arial" size="2">This
means that the evidence must address a specific point which explains how or why
the applicant should be considered to have Extraordinary Ability.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Arial" size="2">For
instance, researchers usually present evidence of publications, but some also
provide evidence of presentations. One might argue that such evidence is not
presented well. The applicant might argue that a presentation is a technique for
communicating one's findings to others in the field. This is the objective of a
research publication as well, so the relevance should be demonstrated easily.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">2)
The evidence must be 'Competent'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Arial" size="2">This
means that the evidence provided must be convincing. For example, if an
applicant provides evidence of presentation at a international conference, he or
she can submit letters from the conference organizers confirming that a
paper has been accepted, including copies of printed abstracts, conference
programs, or other documents which come from the conference. Thus, this is a
strong evidence that there really was a presentation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Arial" size="2">If
however, one has kept little evidence of his or her presentation, it is not
reasonable to believe a conference program as the only evidence of presentation,
in which the applicant's name is not mentioned in any way.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">3)
The evidence must be 'Material'</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Arial" size="2">This
means that the evidence must be significant. For example, if a researcher has
presented a brief report to the staff members at his or her laboratory on a
monthly basis, this is not really the type of evidence that the USCIS is
seeking.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Arial" size="2">For
most applicants, the presentations should be at national or international
conferences, and other related information should also be provided to USCIS. To
meet the evidence requirement of being significant, the applicant may also
explain each type of the following evidence:</font></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Arial" size="2">the
    paper selection process and peer-reviewing;</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none" class="MsoHyperlink"><font face="Arial" size="2">the
    publishing proceedings;</font></span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Arial" size="2">the
    attendance at the conference;</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Arial" size="2">the
    organizer of the conference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none" class="MsoHyperlink"><o:p>By
explaining how each type of evidence within a category is important, the
applicant can pass this final test.<o:p>  </span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none" class="MsoHyperlink">The
above tests should be applied to all evidence. The one underlying issue in terms
of relevance is whether the evidence helps to build an argument that you have
the requisite level of ability.</span></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">2. How to Effectively Collect Your Evidence</font>
  </b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To prove you have
&quot;Extraordinary Ability&quot;, you should
collect the documents in the following area for your EB1-Extraordinary Ability
petition:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">1) Receipt of prizes or awards in
an academic field. </font>This includes copies of
awards you have received as well as copies of application materials which indicate the criteria
used for the awards. While it is very hard to obtain a major prize or to prove the prize you received
is major, any minor prizes or awards would contribute to your
&quot;Extraordinary Ability&quot;. Some conferences or magazines often issue
such prizes as &quot;Best Paper Award.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font face="Arial" size="2">Also,
for this category, if you have a copy of an award letter or a copy of a
certificate, that would be helpful. If you have participated in research under a
grant, you might want to include a copy of a grant award letter. In a letter of
support, a person might mention how your work was instrumental in obtaining the
grant. Generally, any copies of prizes and certificates will help the petition,
and these prizes and awards should be quoted in the petition cover letter.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">2) Membership in academic associations</font>.
Copies of membership cards are helpful. If you can obtain some printed material
about the organization, such as membership criteria, that could also be useful.
You can simply go to the organization's web site and download a few pages of
information which can be used in your petition. Another good tactic for this
criterion is to have one or more of the letters of support reference the
prestige or high standards of a specific association, or make some reference to
the fact that your membership in a particular association is a good indication
of the outstanding nature of your work. You may also include letters from an
official within an association, congratulating you on the conferred membership.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font face="Arial" size="2">While most associations only require a membership fee to qualify, some associations
do have a
member election process which requires certain qualifications. Certificates or evidence of memberships in professional
societies as well as evidence of what criteria were used in selecting members
should be included. Some professional societies such as Sigma Xi select their members through nomination procedures and
are based upon recognition of achievement in a
field. There are some
examples of membership not considered to be achievement by USCIS, including ACS,
AICHE, ASME, ASEE, etc.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">3) Published material in professional
publications or news media.</font> This includes articles written by others about your work in
an academic field, such as papers published by other people citing your name or
work, and other people’s Master’s thesis or PhD dissertation citing papers with
your name.&nbsp;This also includes any general literature discussing your present work and any literature discussing the present projects upon
which you are working. You can also do a computer on-line citation search to see if any paper
cites your published work. Most university’s libraries are capable of doing
this kind of search.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">4)
Citation by other researchers</font>. If possible, a printout of a citation
check from a Science Index, or some other type of citation check is helpful.
Depending upon the number of citations, it can also be helpful to include a
letter from someone who is not necessarily familiar with your work, explaining
the significance of being cited by others. You can also submit actual samples of
articles by other researchers including citations to your work.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">5) Participation on a
panel or individually. </font>If you have reviewed papers for a magazine or a conference, or worked as a judge of the work of others in the same or an allied academic
field, you can collect this kind of evidence. You may need to submit the document
of your review. You can also ask the magazine
editor or the conference organizer to write a letter for you indicating you have
done the reviewing, or include copies of letters from journal editors requesting
you review a paper.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font face="Arial" size="2">A
support letter that references the fact that you served on a panel for Ph.D candidates can also be useful. Anything
will help, if it will show you participating in review activities where you are
judging the work or performance of others.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">6) Original scientific or scholarly research contributions to
the academic field. </font>This includes all kinds of research activities in the
form of publications, presentations, inventions, patents, etc. Therefore, you
would include copies of anything that would show your participation in
professional conferences, like copies of agendas, abstracts, and fliers. This
criterion depends heavily on the letters of support, where the letter writer
references your work, offering statement about the importance of the research or
teaching activity, its novelty, how your particular expertise makes such work
possible and more effective. If you are involved in grant activities, you would
also use that information in this criterion as well as in the
&quot;prizes/awards&quot; criterion, depending upon the type of documentation
and verification, so any letters or other documents dealing with grants would be
useful.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">You can also include
copies of publications and theses; just the cover page and second page are
enough in some cases.&nbsp;But submitting the entire thesis is important in some
cases also, such as if the subsequent publications are based upon the thesis work, or
if the alien is a co-author with others and their individual contribution may be unclear as a result.
Degree theses and
dissertations are always authored by a single individual, whose research provides a basis for an argument that subsequent
publications/presentations are based upon.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">7) Authorship of scholarly books or
articles. </font>The articles should be published in
scholarly journals with national or international circulation and in an academic field. It is
better to have at least two papers published or accepted for publication.
Chapters in books with ISBN numbers are counted. Thus, you would want to include
copies of journal submissions, book chapters, etc. If there are numerous
publications, you may include copies of the first 1-2 pages of a good sampling
of the articles. If there are not a great number of publications listed on your
CV, it is a good idea to include a full copy of each of the articles.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font face="Arial" size="2">Copies
of letters from journal editors informing you that a submission has been
accepted would also be helpful, and anything else along those lines. When you
start putting the petition documents together, you would also want to include
copies of support letters to emphasize that your work is published in journals,
which is an indication of your outstanding contributions.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">8) Reference letters from you degree
advisors. </font>The reference letters should strongly argue
that you are excellent and have extraordinary ability. The reference letter from your former advisor would be
ideal if he or she appraises your previous work as well as comments on the
importance of your current work.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">9) Reference letters from other professionals.</font>
These professionals include your college professors, your colleagues with
certain qualifications, and your supervisors.&nbsp;Usually, if you tell them that the reference letters are for immigration purposes, you will get
good
words. You should ask all your reference writers to address the letter to USCIS, and send
the letter to you opened.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">10) Comments on your published papers from
your peer-reviewers.</font> These are also very important evidence. Even though most of those
comments might be critics of details of your paper, one sentence which says
&quot;the paper has original contribution to the research, I recommend it be
published&quot; is at least there. Otherwise, your paper cannot be published.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">11) All the postcards or
emails that request your published
papers.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">12) Letters or emails from your employer or co-researchers,
</font> which
comments on your research importance and your excellent performance in the
research project.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">13) Your employer's research proposals,</font> which
mention the research importance, project applications, and project funding
resources from any federal government, federal agency, state government, or
private company. These evidences can be used to prove that your research is important. Naturally, if you are working
on a federal funded research project, a copy of the proposal to the funding
agency, such as NIH, NSF, DOD, DOE, EPA, USDA, DOT, etc., would be easy to prove your
work is important and you are outstanding.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">14) Research reports or project progress
reports.</font><font color="#0000FF">  </font>Even
if these reports are not published yet, or if they will never be published due to
confidential reasons, these evidences will also help you prove that you have
extraordinary ability and your research is important.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">15) Papers presented in academic
conference. </font>Copies of symposia and conference agenda which indicate that
you were a participant, whether as a
research paper presenter or peer reviewer of other individuals' work. Even if a paper is not officially
published in some cases, it will still help your petition.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#006666">16) Any evidences from your clients, research sponsors, official publications,
</font>
which can be used to prove that your research results may be used by other
companies or government agencies.</font></p>

  </blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The
USCIS adjudicators who examine the EB1-EA applications are unlikely to be of the same academic caliber and educational
level as the petitioning alien. In fact, USCIS has indicated that the examiners of these particular applications are only bachelors degree holders, many of them in non-scientific areas. Consequently, it is
necessary to present the evidence in a way which is easily understandable for these
examiners.</font></p>
