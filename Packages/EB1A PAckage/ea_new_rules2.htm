Evaluation for EB1 - Extraordinary Ability: Evaluate Whether the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Effective August 18, 2010,
USCIS Immigration Service Officers (ISOs) will follow the amended procedures in the adjudication of all Form I-140 petitions filed for
EB1 Aliens
of Extraordinary Ability. In general, the petition must be accompanied by initial
evidence that:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">(a) the alien has sustained national or international acclaim;
and&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"> (b) the alien’s achievements have been recognized in the field of
expertise.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"> The initial evidence must include either evidence of a one-time
achievement (i.e., a major international recognized award, such as the Nobel
Prize), or at least three of the ten types of evidence. ISOs
must use a <b><i> two-part analysis</i></b> to determine eligibility First, the ISO must determine if the petitioner has, by a preponderance
of the evidence, met at least three of the criteria, and then the ISO should
consider all of the evidence in totality in making the <b><i> final merits
determination</i></b>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">To evaluate whether the
evidence provided meets at least three criteria, ISOs must determine whether the
petition is supported by evidence of a one-time achievement (that is, a major,
internationally recognized award). If it is not, then they must make a
determination that is limited to whether the evidence submitted in the petition
meets at least three criteria as discussed below.&nbsp;</font></p>

              provision provides petitioners the opportunity to submit
              comparable evidence to establish the alien beneficiary's
              eligibility, if it is determined that the standards do not readily
              apply to the alien’s occupation. When evaluating such
              &quot;comparable&quot; evidence, consider whether the criteria are
              readily applicable to the alien’s occupation and, if not,
              whether the evidence provided is truly comparable to the criteria

              claims that USCIS should accept witness letters as comparable
              evidence are not persuasive. The petitioner should explain clearly
              why it has not submitted evidence that would satisfy at least
              three of the criteria as well as why the evidence it has submitted
              is &quot;comparable&quot; to that required. On the other hand, the

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666"><font size="2" face="Arial">2. Part Two Evaluation for Final Merits
Determination and the P</font><font size="2" face="Arial">ossible Trend&nbsp;</font></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> Meeting the minimum requirement of providing evidence relating to
at least three criteria does not, in itself, establish that the alien in fact
meets the requirements for classification as an Alien of Extraordinary Ability. In making this determination,
the quality of the evidence, such as whether the
judging responsibilities were internal and whether the scholarly articles (if
pertinent to the occupation) are cited, is an appropriate consideration in the
final merits determination.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> In addition, the alien’s performance at the
so-called major-league level does not automatically establish that he or she
meets the extraordinary ability standards. Also, Congress intended that in
the absence of a one-time achievement, an alien could qualify for the
classification based on a “career of acclaimed work.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">In Part Two of the analysis in
each case, ISOs will consider all of the evidence to make a final merit
determination of whether or not the petitioner, by a preponderance of the
evidence, has demonstrated that the alien has:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) A level of expertise
indicating that the individual is “<i><u>one of that small percentage who have risen
to the very top of the field of endeavor</u></i>.” and</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) <u><i> Sustained national or
international acclaim</i></u> and that his or her achievements have been recognized in
the field of expertise.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
possible trend involves a final adjudication from the USCIS using the second step in its analysis in
most cases, without regard to the findings made during the initial review of the evidence. In many cases where the USCIS determines that the petitioner meets the initial evidentiary requirements, denials still are issued. This is due to the second step, wherein the USCIS often determines that the evidence, taken in totality, does not show that the petitioner has reached the level of accomplishment required for the requested classification.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Meeting the regulatory criteria of EB-1A in Part
One alone does not establish that the alien applicant indeed meets the requirements as an Alien of Extraordinary Ability. In part one, USCIS officer will only determine if the evidence objectively meets the regulatory criteria. The issue related to if the alien applicant is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field, and also enjoys sustained national or international acclaim should be determined in
Part Two of the analysis,&nbsp;<br>
<br>
For example, USCIS may consider the following situations:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) The judging of the work of others in the same field of specialization should satisfy the EB-1A criteria in
  Part One. But for Part Two consideration, the alien’s participation of judging of the work of others should be evaluated to determine if it was indicative of the alien applicant being one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field, and also enjoying a sustained national or international acclaim.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) The article publications in professional or major trade publications should satisfy the EB-1A criteria in
  Part One. But for Part Two consideration, the alien applicant’s publications should be evaluated to determine if they were indicative of the alien being one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field, and also enjoying sustained national or international acclaim.</font></p>
