    <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear
    Sir or Madam:</font></span></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is my pleasure to write this letter in support of Dr.
Zheng Xiao’s application for
Permanent Residency in the United States, in the immigration category of EB1-Extraordinary
Ability.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I received a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the Institute of Neurological Sciences at the University of California - San Francisco. After six years of training at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, I relocated to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where I
am currently a Professor of Neurology at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine. I am
the Director of the Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory and oversee the research of 10-12 individuals in my laboratory where the focus of our work is on the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic proteins across the blood-brain barrier for the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. I have held this position at Mayo for the past 15 years, and therefore, I am in a unique position to be able to evaluate the talent of research fellows
in my laboratory.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Xiao obtained his education in Chemistry from
Nanjing University in China. At the same university, he also received his MS degree in Organic Chemistry with first rank, which identifies him as a student with outstanding talent. Dr.
Xiao obtained his Ph.D. degree in the year 2008 and moved to the laboratory of Prof. Rupak Marsh at the Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry at Gottingen,
Germany, on a Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship, which is a highly respected fellowship
awarded to the very best candidates based on international competition.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The research focus in my laboratory is on the design and chemical synthesis of magnetic resonance contrast agents, for the in-vivo molecular imaging of Alzheimer’s disease amyloid plaques by high field strength magnetic resonance. This is also coupled with novel therapeutic approaches for passive immunization with derivatives of monoclonal antibodies against human A&#946;42 that are designed to have increased permeability at the blood-brain barrier and high affinity binding to amyloid plaques.
Dr. Xiao has been in my laboratory for the past 2 years as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow where I am a supervisor of his research along with Dr.
Rizwan Phillipse. Through my work with Dr. Xiao, I believe that he has extraordinary ability in his research endeavors which provide unique contributions to the field of antibody-based contrast agents for high field strength
MRI.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since Dr. Xiao joined my research group as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow,
he carried out original research projects that led to 5 publications in highly respected and peer-reviewed international journals, including
<i> Biochemistry</i> published by the American Chemical Society, and <i> Biophysical Journal</i>
published by the American Biophysical Society.  Dr. Xiao’s research work in my laboratory significantly helped in
establishing research projects on lipid phase behavior and polymorphism and lipid-protein interactions of bovine seminal plasma proteins,
that are the two areas in which we now are among the leading groups in the world.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Also, Dr. Xiao has developed the technology for fragmenting a monoclonal antibody against human A&#946;42 to generate F(ab¢)2 fragments. He has
developed the technology to couple DOTA-gadolinium to this F(ab¢)2 fragment to allow for contrast enhancement on MR imaging, as well as to polyamine modify this derivative to allow for its increased permeability at the blood-brain barrier
and its increased targeting ability of amyloid plaques after intravenous administration. He has been able to verify both of these modifications using chemical procedures in the laboratory, and we are currently testing the ability of this contrast agent to alter T1-weighted relaxation using high field strength 9.4 Tesla MR microimaging, after intravenous administration in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> The development of such contrast agents will be extremely important for allowing early detection of Alzheimer’s disease in patients, so that therapies can be initiated prior to the onset of significant dementia. Dr.
Xiao has been instrumental in developing these unique modifications of this antibody derivative.&nbsp;Dr. Xiao is the first author of two papers that
have been submitted for publication, and he is currently organizing his data in preparation for a manuscript on which he will be the first author also.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Xiao has also started a very hopeful project that aims at developing protein-based molecular tools to detect Alzheimer’s disease. Dr.
Xiao’s
extraordinary research ability and contributions are highly valued by his colleagues and professors here, and it is expected that his work will aid in finding diagnostic tools for the detection of Alzheimer’s disease, which is expected to affect millions of Americans and people of other countries in the coming years.
Dr. Xiao's research work is essential to better manage this dreaded disease.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I wish to be clear that Dr. Xiao has not been offered a permanent position at
our research lab. Rather, I am writing this letter to express my opinion of Dr.
Xiao’s superior talents and
extraordinary abilities based upon my observation of his research activities here, and to offer my assessment of Dr.
Xiao’s potential contributions to this country. He should be allowed to remain in U.S. permanently and prospectively benefit the United States in his extremely valuable field of endeavor.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Dr. Xiao's original research and significant contributions to the field of Alzheimer’s disease will play a major role in allowing early diagnosis of a disease that currently is only definitively diagnosed at autopsy. I strongly recommend
U.S. Permanent Residency for this highly talented individual and leader in the field of Alzheimer’s disease research.</font></p>
