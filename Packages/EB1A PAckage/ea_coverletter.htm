EB1-EA does not require Labor Certification,

0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:110%"><font size="2" face="Arial">For
EB1-EA petition, the most significant issue
is that you need to prepare a formal petition
cover letter based on all the documents you have, including the recommendation
letters and your achievement evidence. You should remember that documents such as the letters of
recommendation are only supporting evidence, and it is the formal petition cover
letter that is directly reviewed by USCIS immigration
officers.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:11.25pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:
0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:110%"><font size="2" face="Arial">In most
cases, the formal petition cover letter may be the only document that will be
carefully read by an immigration officer. The content and quality of the
petition cover letter will either make or fail your case. A carefully written
petition cover letter often takes a great amount of time to write. An
EB1-EA petition cover letter should be a result of many hours of analyzing the
documents and your technical background in view of the legal
requirements, and many more hours of drafting and revising in order to prepare
a good and solid petition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The cover letter brings the
evidence you are presenting together:&nbsp;</font></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">First, your cover letter
    should explain your field of endeavor, and perhaps what criteria should be
    considered to determine your excellence in a field.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Second, it should explain
    the evidence that you have provided with the application, towards the criteria which USCIS has set for this category.&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Third, by giving reference
    to your current work/project and how you keep on updating your professional skills,
    it
    should explain the evidence you have
    presented, and prove that you are still applying your skill set that you are
    claiming as extraordinary abilities. <o:p>
    </o:p>
    &nbsp; </font></li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Some applicants believe that they have read the
USCIS regulations and that they feel
prepared to file their applications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> The fact</span>
is that the regulations will get you about part of the way to know
enough to file a successful application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The
reason is that the regulations list only the objective evidence which is required for
EB1-EA category.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="2">T</font></span><font size="2">he
USCIS examiners have broad
judgment to evaluate the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It is not enough to provide basic documentation to satisfy the
EB1-EA regulations. The USCIS examiners will go
through the evidence and decide if it is substantial enough to distinguish you
from the others.<span style="mso-spacerun:

just list your evidence and expect a USCIS examiner to approve your application.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"> Some people with a denied case have
sent a petition cover letter to
the USCIS which looks like a resume. Over 80% of people who have filed their own cases, and come to
<a href="http://www.greencardapply.com/rfe.htm" target="_blank"><font color="#006666"> our help
for the USCIS issued Request For Evidence (RFE)</font></a> later, had their petition cover letters
prepared to look like a
resume addressed to the USCIS. These people do not realize that the petition
cover letter is the most important part
of the EB1-EA application. The petition cover letters typically range in length
from 15 to 25 pages long.</font></p>
