      USCIS' View of the Scientific Citations for EB1 Extraordinary Ability
      Application</b><br>
        </font><font color="#333333">
      <br>
      </font>In scientific fields, citations are required
      in most cases when a researcher uses another scientist's research findings
      of for his or her own research. These citations are normally not
      considered to be probative for the alien applicant's extraordinary ability
      in the field. When evaluating citations to an alien’s work, USCIS will
      evaluate the submitted citations to determine the significance of the
      alien applicant’s original contribution to the field.<br>
      <br>
      The frequent citations by independent researchers may show the interest in
      alien’s work, and may serve as evidence that the alien applicant is
      indeed an authoritative in the field. In some situations, alien’s
      significant and original contributions in a field can bring the subsequent
      references and citations.<br>
      <br>
      As an example, consistent references and citations by other researchers
      for an advanced technology developed by the alien applicant would be
      relevant to the alien's extraordinary ability. But other researcher's
      citations to the alien’s similar research techniques without accrediting
      any significant findings to the alien applicant may not be probative.<br>
      <br>
      USCIS understand that scientific researchers normally give credit to other
      researchers in the field to avoid potential plagiarism. Such credit may
      not accredit the merits of the other researchers' work. Thus, USCIS will
      evaluate the submitted evidence to determine if the citations are an
      indication of the alien's extraordinary ability.</font>

        The Relation between Citations and a Petitioner's Field&nbsp;</font></b>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">As many of
        alien applicants are aware, citations to an EB1-Extraordinary Ability petitioner’s
        peer reviewed publications are one of the primary forms of objective evidence to demonstrate
        a petitioner’s impact on his or her field. In certain cases, a petitioner may be well
        qualified for approval, but may not have a particularly strong citation list to indicate
        objective influence in the field. Here, we will explore some of the successful strategies
        to overcome this apparent shortcoming.<br>
        <br>
        When discussing citations, the type of field that a petitioner works in is one of the
        fundamental indicators of how many potential citations a petitioner may have. It is
        widely accepted that petitioners in the life sciences will usually have more citations than
        a petitioner in the electronic engineering field, due to the rich culture of citations that has
        traditionally been fostered by the life sciences, and the proprietary issues that usually
        accompany new discoveries in electronic engineering.&nbsp;</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial"> This distinction was expressly
        recognized by the USCIS in a liaison meeting with the immigration
        community. When asked if it recognized differences between fields for publication and citation rates, the
        USCIS explained that it did indeed recognize that some fields would have higher
        publication/citations rates than others and adjust its adjudication accordingly. The
        USCIS also added that it had compiled its own guidelines on now much a typical researcher
        might cite or publish for a particular field.</font>

        Use the
Alien Beneficiary's Field to Its Best Effect:&nbsp;</font></b><p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">When the USCIS denies an
EB1-Extraordinary Ability petition, one of the more common reasons given for the denial is that there were not enough citations
to the petitioner’s work to demonstrate a significant impact on the field. But
when the right strategies are used, petitioners can overcome this apparent shortcoming and still win approval for the petition.
As the two examples demonstrate below, it is possible to get approvals for
petition cases with low citation counts, if you strategically use the alien
beneficiary's field to its best effect.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i><u>Example
  One:</u></i></b> The petitioner is a materials scientist who worked for a private company.
  He had a solid background with some recognition in the field, but only had 13 total
  citations to his 5 peer-reviewed publications published in the last few years.<br>
  <br>
  To overcome this low citation count, the petitioner submitted a citation report which showed that
  for the last 2 years, articles in the materials sciences have averaged 1.18 and
  0.91 citations per year respectively. By demonstrating that the petitioner’s citation count was
  actually higher than the expected average, the petitioner was able to turn an apparent shortcoming
  into a strength. This case was approved in eight months from original submission after
  receiving an Request For Evidence (RFE) from USCIS.&nbsp;</font><p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i><u>Example
  Two:</u></i></b> 		The petitioner was a neuroscientist who was working on pharmaceuticals to
  inhibit certain receptors in the brain to help with pain tolerance. In addition to his
  fundamental research, he was working on a drug that was being tested in clinical
  trials at the time of submission. He had 6 publications in the field and a total of
  26 citations.<br>
  <br>
  For this case, the petitioner could have fairly been classified as either a researcher in the
  neurosciences or a researcher in clinical medicine. While deciding which type of field to
  classify him in, the petitioner noticed that articles in clinical medicine had an average citation rate
  of 9.49 citations per year, while the neurosciences had an average rate of 17.82 citations
  per year. Due to his low citation count, he was presented as a researcher in clinical
  medicine, which brought his average citation count well above the yearly average for the
  field. This case was approved in approximately 6 months without an RFE.</font>

The Strategies for Low Citation Count - Highlight the Impact Factors for
High-Quality Journals</font></b>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">Another effective method in overcoming a low citation count is to highlight the Impact Factors for any&nbsp;high-quality journals in which the petitioner may have published.  Publications in journals with high Impact Factors, such as Nature,&nbsp;Cell, or IEEE Signal Processing can be used as persuasive evidence of impact on the field to compensate for low citation counts.  Since
the Impact Factor ranking is roughly a measure of the number of citations an average article receives in a particular publication, an
article published in a high Impact Factor journal usually means that the article will eventually obtain a high citation count.  This
information can be used to extrapolate the potential for future citations.
Therefore, the petitioner should focus on Impact Factors for relatively new publications which have not had time to accrue large citation counts.</font>
      <blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i><u>Example:</u></i></b> 
The petitioner was a recently graduated biochemistry post-doctor from a respected university in California.  Two of his articles were
published in journals with Impact Factors above 10.0.  However, because many of his articles were recently published, he did not have
enough time to accrue a significant number of citations.  In the argument for this case,
he focused on the Impact Factors of his publications.  Additionally, he provided the average citation count over time in the biochemistry field to show that while his
overall citation count was low, for publications that were less than two years old like his, the citation counts were actually well&nbsp;above average.  In this way,
he was able to demonstrate that the he was ahead of the curve in citations even though the&nbsp;overall number was low.
This case was approved in approximately six months after receiving an RFE.</font>

The Strategies for Low Citation Count - Use Journal Rankings for the
Publications</font></b>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial">Another effective strategy to supplement a petitioner’s low citation count is to use journal rankings for the publications.  Journal&nbsp;rankings should be distinguished from journal Impact Factors:  Impact Factors are roughly a measure of how many citations the average
article receives when published in a given journal.  Journal rankings, however, are usually a general measure of how many citations a
journal receives when compared to other journals in the field. This is a very important distinction for petitioners that are in&nbsp;emerging or less popular scientific fields.&nbsp;</font>
      <blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i><u>Example:</u></i></b> 
The petitioner’s field was Oceanography, a highly specialized area of study that focuses on the science of the Earth’s oceans.
Due to the specialized nature of Oceanography, citations to journals in this field are significantly lower than journals in fields such
as Biology or Chemistry; thus, the Impact Factors for journals focused on oceanography are significantly lower than other major fields&nbsp;of research.
For example, a majority of the petitioner’s publications were in a journal that had a low Impact Factor of roughly 1.5.&nbsp;This meant that, for this case, the petitioner not only had a low citation count but also had a low Impact Factor due to her field of&nbsp;specialization.</font>

        </b><br>
        The citations can only be shown if one actually has some independent
        citations of one’s papers. If you do not have many citations, you can
        show a download count of your papers or programs by other researchers.
        According to USCIS officers, many independent citations of an
        applicant’s papers or a large number of downloads of an applicant’s
        papers or programs prove the applicant’s work or achievement has a
