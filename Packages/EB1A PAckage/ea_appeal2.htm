    A Motion to Reopen or A Motion to Reconsider&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">In
    addition to the right to appeal in which you ask a higher authority to
    review a denial, you may file a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider
    with the USCIS Service Center that made the unfavorable decision. By filing
    these motions, you ask the USCIS Service Center to reexamine or
    reconsider its decision. A motion to reopen must state the new facts that
    are to be provided in the reopened proceeding, and must be accompanied by
    affidavits or other documentary evidence.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">If
    the petition was denied because you left out necessary documents that have
    since been located, the new documents should be sent, together with a
    written request that the case be reopened to the same USCIS Service Center
    that issued the denial. This is called “Motion to Reopen”. These is a
    fee to file this motion. Appeals often take a long time. A Motion to Reopen
    can be concluded faster then an appeal.<o:p>
    &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    A motion to reconsider must establish that the decision was based on an
    incorrect application of law or USCIS policy, and further establish that the
    decision was incorrect based on the evidence in the file at the time the
    decision was made. Any motion to reopen or reconsider must be filed with the
    correct fee within 30 days of the decision.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">A
    motion to reopen or reconsider a USCIS decision must be filed on <b> <i> Form I-290B - Notice of Appeal or
    Motion</i>.</b> You file this form to notify USCIS that you are filing a motion to reopen or reconsider a USCIS decision
    regarding your case. The motion must be filed with the USCIS Service Center that made the original decision. An explanation
    and evidence may be filed in support of your motion, and a fee must be
    included.</font></p>

    Re-filing in the Same Category and the Suggested Alternatives&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">For the appeal, the
best way to handle an appeal is to try to avoid it. Filing an appeal means making
an argument to the USCIS that its reasoning or facts were wrong. This is
difficult to do successfully. If you think you can eliminate the
reason why the petition failed by improving the paperwork, it makes sense to disregard the
appeal process and simply file a new petition, better prepared than the first
    one.<o:p>
    &nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">
    If your EB1-Extraordinary Ability petition fails, it is recommended to NOT file an appeal if you do not have strong evidence.
    An appeal to the AAO takes a year or longer to be decided, and it is unlikely
    in most cases to lead to a reversal.
If you think your EB1-Extraordinary Ability case is strong enough, you can file an appeal. Otherwise,
you can re-file EB1-Extraordinary Ability, or try other immigration categories such as
    EB1-Outstanding Researcher or Outstanding Professor, National Interest
    Waiver (NIW), or even Labor Certification.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Basically, you can re-file the same category
after its denial. The only requirement is that you should disclose the
information about your previous denied I-140 case in your new I-140 petition.
The Form I-140 requests the information of previous filing.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To overcome the previous denial, you should add
new evidence to the new petition. If you work as a researcher or an engineer, most likely you have more patents, academic papers, journal articles, and
more citations. These are the information that the regulations requests for EB1-EA,
EB1-OR,
and NIW petitions. Your recent </font><font size="2" face="Arial"> EB1-Extraordinary Ability
denial</font><font size="2" face="Arial"> will not affect the following new
filings.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Therefore,
    the suggested alternatives include:</font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) File the
      Form I-140 petition again, with whatever additional publications or other materials
      available, and addressing the reasons for the initial denial.<br>
    <br>
    2) Consider filing an EB1-Outstanding Researcher or Outstanding Professor, or
      National Interest Waiver petition, if you are one of the top few in a field, or if
      you have made a significant accomplishment in a field of U.S. National
      Interest.<br>
    <br>
    3) Consider traditional Labor Certification, which allows restrictive requirements based on business necessity, and can help focus on the beneficiary’s particular skills required by the petitioner.<br>
    <br>
    4) Finally, do not forget to think about other paths to U.S. Permanent
      Residence, including family-based sponsorship, spouse’s employment-based options, the diversity visa lottery program, or asylum.&nbsp;<br>
