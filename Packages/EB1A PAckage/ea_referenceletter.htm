Confusion
about the Reference Letters in an EB1-EA Petition&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
      <font size="2" face="Arial">Many EB1 extraordinary ability application include
      contain reference letters. Certain testimonials written by other
      experts working in the alien applicant’s field may be submitted as
      evidence. But the reference letters should not be the cornerstone of a
      successful application of EB1 extraordinary ability.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">There is some confusion
about the reference letters (recommendation letters or supporting letters) in an
EB1-EA petition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
</o:p>With the EB1-EA application numbers continuing to
rise, the USCIS takes different actions.<o:p>
</o:p>First, the USCIS stated that if
a person were of the requisite level of ability, he or she should be able to get
<o:p>reference letters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This sounded reasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>After
all, if a person were applying for a job, the employer would <o:p>likely want references.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The result was that everyone
acquired reference letters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The second USCIS move was to
say that the reference letters had to be of a specific type.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>They had to be from independent <o:p>sources and should not be
from referrers who came from the same country as the applicant. There were a lot of <o:p>problems with these
statements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>First, it favored
applicants who were well-connected to professors and researchers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>This is not exactly a sign
of extraordinary ability. Second, it
cut out referrers from the person's home country who <o:p>could best comment on the
applicant's work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The USCIS backed
away from this stance later, although a few examiners still believe that is
reasonable.<o:p></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">2.
      USCIS' View of the Reference Letters for EB1 Extraordinary Ability
      Application</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The statements in the reference letters should be corroborated with
      the submitted evidence. The reference letters should explain why he or she
      believe that the alien beneficiary is in the EB1 extraordinary ability
      caliber. If a reference letter merely reiterates the EB1 extraordinary
      ability definitions, or merely make expansive statements for the
      beneficiary's accomplishments, this kind of reference letter is not
      persuasive.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">When USCIS evaluates the statements in the reference letter, the
      relationship between the alien applicant and the reference letter writer
      is also an important considering factor. USCIS expects that an alien
      beneficiary in the EB1 extraordinary ability caliber should receive
      recognition beyond the circle of personal and professional acquaintances.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      In some cases, the statements in the reference letters make general
      assertions about the alien applicant, and may indicate that the alien is a
      competent or a respected person, but the writers of the reference letters
      fail to support such statements with sufficient evidence. USCIS may
      consider such reference letters, but they do not necessarily show the
      beneficiary’s extraordinary ability.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">To
      assist the USCIS' assessment of the alien’s original contributions in a
      field, USCIS officers will consider the reference letters from experts in
      the fields regarding the significance of the alien’s contributions. But
      only reference letters that specifically indicate the alien applicant’s
      contributions of major significance to the field and its impact on
      subsequent work could add value for the EB-1A petition. The reference
      letters that lack specifics do not add value, and will not be considered
      to be probative evidence by USCIS.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3. The
Reference Letters Should be Written and Used as Supporting Evidence for Your Petition</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The reference letters should be
written and used as supporting evidence for your EB1-EA petition. The most important rule is that there is no proper format for the reference letters. In fact, if you get more than one reference letter, they should be of varying formats. The worst thing to do is
to obtain several reference letters which are all "clones."  The USCIS examiners will believe that these letters were actually prepared by the applicant, rather than by the actual
referrers.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The reference letters should be used
properly as your supporting evidence. Some applicants have been writing the letters themselves and
then having the referrers sign them. This has led to large numbers of letters which all look the same. They contain the same
comments and use the same statements about
extraordinary ability or U.S. national interest.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
While the USCIS examiners are not highly trained in the applicants' fields, they can easily recognize that such letters are rarely the product of the
referrers. This has led some examiners to increase the standards of the reference letters, i.e. asking for letters from
U.S. government agencies and independent experts.  No one wins when USCIS examiners
ask for such stringent evidence, so it is important that reference letters be used with care.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Generally, reference letters should be written by the referrer, so that the USCIS examiner can see
the differences, even if they are only grammatical
differences and personal touches. In one previous case, a USCIS Service Center received five reference letters
from an applicant and they were all strong, but they were all written by the applicant and signed by the referrers. They were rendered useless because they contained the same repeated grammatical errors.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"> It is suggested that an applicant should obtain drafts and then discuss them
with the referrers. One thing to keep in mind is that the USCIS examiners have seen hundreds of letters, and they can tell which
ones are simply
applicant-cloned products. There is no number of reference letters you should get.
Three strong reference letters are better than 10 average letters.&nbsp;<br>

Adjudicator's View of the Reference Letters</font></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Almost all EB1-EA petitions contain reference
letters, and reference letters should form the cornerstone of a successful claim for the
EB1-Extraordinary Ability classification. The statements made by the referrers should be corroborated by
documented evidence in the record. The letters should explain in specific terms why the referrers
believe the beneficiary to be of Extraordinary Ability caliber.<br>
<br>
Letters that merely reiterate USCIS’ EB1-EA definitions, or make general and expansive statements regarding the beneficiary and his or her accomplishments, are generally not persuasive. The relationship or affiliation between the beneficiary and the referrers
is also a factor to consider when evaluating the significance of the referrers’ statements. It is generally expected that an individual whose accomplishments have garnered sustained national or international acclaim would have received recognition for his or her accomplishments well beyond the circle of
personal and professional acquaintances.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Certain testimonials written by other individuals working in the alien’s field of endeavor may be submitted as evidence. In some cases, such testimonials merely make general assertions about the alien, and at most, indicate that the alien is a competent, respected figure within the field of endeavor, but the authors fail to support such statements with sufficient concrete evidence. These
reference letters may be considered by USCIS, but do not necessarily show the beneficiary’s claimed extraordinary ability.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">In some cases, USCIS examiners may request letters from truly independent sources, i.e. people who do not know the applicant at all.  This was seen as unreasonable by almost all
observers in the immigration community.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">5. Other
Issues about the Reference Letters</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">There are many issues to be addressed about
the reference letters.
The reference letters are not required by USCIS, but they can be very useful, and most USCIS examiners for EB1 and NIW applications expect them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some applicants may try to avoid the reference letters for confidentiality purposes, but for others, they are easy to obtain. A more thorough compilation of background materials can offset an absence of
good reference letters.  These materials may include statistics about the area of research, information about professional organizations, awards, journals, etc.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some professional societies usually do not provide reference letters for their members.  In addition,
some U.S. government agencies will simply not prepare a reference letter if asked.
Therefore, the request of reference letters or “independent letters” heavily favors applicants with connections at government agencies or in professional societies, which may
be seen as unfair for some applicants.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <font size="2" face="Arial"> 
The EB1-Extraordinary Ability
immigration category, like the NIW category, is always evolving. The USCIS continues to develop novel interpretations of specific sections of the regulations, so this category will continue to require extensive knowledge of USCIS actions. A review of
approved petitions leads us believe that there is no specific pattern for professional fields of successful applicants.  This is
actually good news, because it probably points to a slight loosening of the EB1-Extraordinary Ability
reins.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">6. Things
that the Referrers Should Not Discuss</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Are there things that the
referrers should not discuss?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  Yes, t</span>here are several
areas which should not be included into the reference letters. Primarily, an area to
avoid involves statements that there is a
shortage of U.S. workers in your field. This will result in the USCIS examiners saying that
you should definitely go through the Labor Certification process, not the EB1-EA application.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="2" face="Arial">Also,
if you were a </font></span><font size="2" face="Arial">Teaching Assistant or Research
Assistant in
a graduate school, the reference letters should avoid concentrating only on your work as a teaching or research assistant while in graduate school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
USCIS </span>examiners will likely say that such information does not distinguish you
from other graduate students.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The referrers frequently find it
    is necessary to comment upon the personality or hard-working nature of the beneficiary.
    While such comments would be appropriate in other contexts, they are not relevant to the issue of whether a particular immigration benefit should be granted.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">7. An
Example of How to Get Reference Letters form People in a National Lab or a
Government Agency</font></b></p>
<blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><u><font size="2" face="Arial">Example:</font></u></i></b> <font size="2" face="Arial"> I
want to apply for EB1-EA soon. My friend told me that U.S. regulation 18 USC §
205 does not allow a federal agency or employee to write a letter in favor of an
alien's immigration. My work helps the National Labs, and I know a letter from
them will be a good one and help my petition.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">How can I handle this
situation? Do you have any suggestions? Can they write a letter just mentioning
that my works helps them, without even mentioning about me - if that is done,
will it be useful for USCIS? Would letters with no government letterhead have
any weight or consideration for the USCIS' adjudicators?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The reason I ask this question is that it is difficult for most of my referees
at federal agencies or national labs to write it on a government letterhead, so
I am little confused. Thank you for your opinion and experiences I really need
it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><u><font size="2" face="Arial">Case Analysis:</font></u></i></b>
<font size="2" face="Arial">
A criminal statute, 18 USC § 205, prohibits a federal employee from making
representations on behalf of another before or to a federal entity, except in
relation to federal employment. Different agencies interpret this differently.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Just remember, not all people
who work for such federal establishment fall under this clause. You can ask them
- if they are not allowed, they will say so. Many alien applicants were able to
get reference letters from different national labs. Yes, they may not be allowed
to write one - but they can always write a &quot;<i>personal professional
opinion</i>&quot;, which means they would not print it on a letterhead, but
otherwise it will be the same. The reference letters do not need to be on the
agency's letterhead, but the writer should enclose a CV with the reference
letter.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Although not applicable in
every case, a general information is that a national lab scientist does not mean
he or she is a federal employee. We know this as many workers in national labs
are contractors, not federal employees. National labs are something called GOCO,
which means “<i>government owned, contractor operated.</i>&quot; So, some of
them may be able to write these letters on their letterheads.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The following is a strategy
used by one alien applicant to get reference letters in a national lab:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;When I first asked one
  person, he was hesitant - I convinced him by showing him another letter
  written by his colleague for another applicant...that way, he became
  comfortable with writing one. In fact, one senior person, who is close to
  retirement, printed it on a government letter head, saying he could not care
  less about such rule...so, try senior people or even ones just retired.&quot;</font></p>
