<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">
1. The Most Common Mistakes Made by Petitioners&nbsp; </font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
The four most common mistakes made by
petitioners are: </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(1) excessive supporting documents; </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(2) poorly drafted petition cover letter;</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(3) poorly drafted expert reference letters;</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(4) inadequately argued presentations.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
Most petitioners confuse quantity with quality.
As a result, they substitute hundreds of pages of supporting documents for a few
crafted supporting exhibits. USCIS examiners have a limited amount of time to
review each petition. If they run out of time while going through an excessively
lengthy petition, they have to take time away from other petitions. Rather, they
will just stop and make a decision based on what they have seen up to that
point.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Therefore, the expert reference letters must establish three
things:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">First, they must establish that the person
    writing the letter is a genuine expert. </font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Second, the letter must clearly explain how
    the letter writer came to know the factual information stated in the letter.
    </font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Third, the expert must offer an opinion that
    is relevant to the matter being considered.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#006666">2. The
Advocacy Is The Most Important Part of a Petition</font> </b>
  </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To avoid the above mistakes, the petitioner
should know that advocacy is the most important part of a
petition. In this case, advocacy means the way the law and facts are argued in
support of the petition. A large number of meritorious cases have been
rejected because of poor advocacy, and a large number of marginal cases have
been approved because of good advocacy. Since
the USCIS has not created any checklists, the examiner must be persuaded that the
case has merit.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
The advocacy is the core of the EB1-EA petition. No matter
how well qualified the beneficiary may be, if the case is not persuasively
argued, it is not going to be approved. A well argued case explains the
attached exhibits and relates the facts to the specific legal requirements
articulated in the statute, regulations, legislative history, USCIS policy memos,
and prior cases. In the end, the argument makes it clear that the petitioner has
put forward a conclusive case for approval.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If the argument is too long and boring, the
examiner will lose interest before understanding the merits of the case. If the
argument is too short and unconvincing, the examiner will not be persuaded. A
successful case strikes the right balance between sufficient detail and argument
to establish eligibility, without unnecessary repetition or the inclusion of
irrelevant facts or arguments.</font></p>

      <p><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3. The EB-1 Adjudication Standards and the Request For Evidence
      - Do NOT Hold Back Some Evidence</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
      <br>
      In a meeting between the immigration community and the USCIS, several issues regarding EB1 adjudication were discussed. Of particular interest was an inquiry regarding USCIS explanation of when it will deny a EB1 case outright, and when it will issue a Request for
      Evidence (RFE), or Notice of Intent to Deny (“NOID”).<br>
      <br>
      The USCIS explained that it may issue an RFE if the required “initial evidence” is provided, but the officer has a question about the approvability of the case or requires additional information or documentation. A NOID may be issued if the officer is leaning toward a denial, but a rebuttal to the specific reason for denial would assist in enduring an appropriate adjudication.
      The USCIS may deny an EB1 case outright, without issuing an RFE or NOID, when a petition is “lacking the required initial
      evidence”.</font></p>

      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">For an EB1-Extraordinary Ability
          (EB1-EA) case, the required initial evidence is defined as either (1) evidence of a major award or achievement, or (2) evidence of three of the 10 EB-1A criteria.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">For an EB1-Outstanding Researcher or Professor
          (EB1-OR) case, the required initial evidence is defined as: (1) evidence to two of the six criteria, (2) Evidence that the alien has at least three years of experience in teaching or research, and (3) an offer of employment from a qualified
          employer.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">These broad definitions of the term “initial evidence” encompass nearly all the substantive evidence an
      EB1-EA or EB1-OR petitioner will present for a case. In practical terms, this means that the USCIS could potentially deny a case outright, without an RFE or NOID, if
      they believe that any pertinent evidence for the case is “lacking.” How the USCIS defines the term “lacking” is unclear, but we have received inquiries from two denied self-petitioners whose cases may offer some insight into this definition. Both EB1 cases that were denied without an RFE or NOID. Although their initial evidence was not very strong, all of the required initial evidence was submitted, thus suggesting the term “lacking” as used by the USCIS means “not good enough” as opposed to “missing”.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Based on the inquiry and the USCIS' answer, and our own observations of EB1 adjudications, it does appear that the USCIS is increasingly issuing denials without giving the petitioner a chance to respond to an RFE or NOID. Keeping this alarming trend in mind, it bears pointing out that it is best to present all available evidence in the initial submission to the USCIS.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><u><font size="2" face="Arial"> We are aware that many petitioners feel that it is wise to hold back some evidence in case an RFE is issued - we never agreed with this strategy, and it could
lead to an outright denial of the case. It is important for petitioners to submit a complete and well presented case to the USCIS to avoid the unhappy result of a denial without an RFE or NOID.</font></u></p>
