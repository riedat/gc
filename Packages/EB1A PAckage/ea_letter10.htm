<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Re: I-140 Immigrant Petition of EB1 Extraordinary Ability
- Dr.
Kevin Yong</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Officer:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is my pleasure to write this letter in support
of Dr. Kevin Yong’s I-140 petition for EB1 Alien of Extraordinary Ability to obtain
permanent resident status in the United States, and also providing the
explanations that his current research and development work is truly
outstanding.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I came to know Dr. Kevin Yong’s research work and
his exceptional ability in my capacity as a director of EDMS (Electronic Document
Management System) project at GE Power System. Dr.
Yong
is a leading researcher in EDMS at GE R&amp;D Center. Since June 2006, Dr.
Yong
has been
working on document management automation research and development for
applications in engineering and government regulatory compliance, as
a principal investigator. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">GE Power System is the world’s leader in power
system research and design. GE Power Systems concurrently manages many national
and international power engineering projects, which may be located in numerous
foreign countries. The EDMS project at GE is an important research and
exploratory development of automating business processes and managing critical
information.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To meet the industry’s strategic and mission
requirements, such as quick Action Items response and appropriate Vendor
Document (VENDOC) management, effective new process development and algorithm
research are essential. These techniques are used to achieve the goal of having
immediate retrieval capability of document in electronic form directly to an
end-user’s desktop while maintaining document security. Dr. Kevin Yong’s recent
demonstration of VENDOC process in EDMS proved his superior
research abilities, and received approval of all evaluation
experts coming from both GE and other organizations,.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">EDMS research and development is also very
important to the American people and government. In 2005, based on Library of
Congress’ <i>National Digital Library Program</i>, the Digital Library
Federation (DLF) was established by &quot;fifteen of the nation's largest
research libraries and archives to create, maintain, expand, and preserve a
distributed collection of digital materials of our nation’s history and
culture accessible to schools, libraries, and American’s home
everywhere.&quot; In this program, how to maintain and preserve digital
documents and records securely and permanently is a challenging research area.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Dr.
Kevin Yong’s current research and development project in the field of
automated document management will have direct contribution to
save our nation’s contemporary and historical information, and his research
result was awarded &quot;<i>Best Research Paper</i>&quot; in recent EDMS international
conference at Paris, French.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">An example that U.S. government agencies can directly
use Dr. Kevin Yong’s research results is the TVA (Tennessee Valley
Authority) projects at GE, which are the construction of STAG
combined-cycle power plants at New Johnsonville, TN and Gallatin, TN. These two
TVA projects are critical to continuous economical development in seven
southeastern states of United Stated. For these TVA
projects, Dr. Kevin Yong’s extraordinary research ability made a significant contribution, including
assigning and tracking TVA’s Action Items, providing a timely and complete
Action Item response to TVA, and managing various types of TVA documents inside
EDMS.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Kevin Yong’s
outstanding research and development work in
EDMS also enables GE Power Systems to keep on being competitive in the global
market, while making their products and services better and faster. According to
GE’s 2008 annual report, &quot;GE Power Systems won $12.5 billion contracts,
and power plant orders increase 120% for the year,&quot; driven by record demand
for gas turbines and maintenance services in the international market.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Kevin Yong earned his Master
degree and Ph.D degree in Electrical Engineering from Cornell University. Before coming to United
States, he had 8 years industry experience as a research engineer in
computer-aided design and simulation in China. He has published eleven papers
with high academic quality
in scientific journals and international conferences.</font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Kevin Yong is an accomplished researcher
whose skills and knowledge in EDMS and information technology is exceptional. The EDMS research and
development is one of the key technological areas
in which the U.S. must dominate in order to maintain the high-tech strength of
the nation in the global market.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Dr. Kevin Yong has extraordinary research ability,
and his continuous research work will provide more contributions and prosperity to our
nation. I believe that this letter will serve to strengthen Dr. Kevin Yong’s case,
and that his petition will be granted. If there are any questions, please feel
free to contact me.</font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sincerely</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jeremy Collins<br>Director of EDMS Project<br>GE Power
Systems</font></p>
