<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">1. A
Successful EB1-Extraordinary Ability Approval Story and Submitted Reference
Letters&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The alien applicant filed
EB1-EA based I-140 Petition and received approval quickly. The submitted evidence demonstrated that
the alien researcher had a record of conducting groundbreaking research in the field of
medical and biological research, specifically in the area of DNA research and its application in cancer. He presented proof
that his work had resulted in advancements of significant benefit to research on viral infections, diabetes, tuberculosis,
pneumonia, and antibiotic resistance.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"> The reference letters testified to the fact that
his DNA research was considered
vital for the development of targets for drugs and vaccines, as well as novel strategies to rectify glitches in DNA and
cure diseases. In addition to improving the health of U.S. citizens, the
reference letters argued that this work also benefits the U.S. environment and
economy, as evidenced by its funding and support through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S.
Department of State (DOS).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The proof used in support of the petition included necessary reference letters from experts in the field. Several of these were
submitted from independent experts from government agencies and premier universities, as well as those of international
renowned, verifying that the applicant was one of the world’s leading experts. These experts stated that his extensive
credentials and abilities could not be replicated by training others in the field, and they placed the applicant at the top
of the field.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The alien applicant authored twelve articles, seven as first author. The articles were published in primary journals in the
field with high Journal Impact Factors. The beneficiary also authored several grant proposals to government organizations
that were awarded federal funding. The applicant's work was presented at international conferences and meetings, including
the prestigious international conferences. He acted as a reviewer of articles for leading journals in the field and also for grant
proposals for government agencies.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The professional literature carried more than seventy favorable citations to this applicant's pioneering research in the
field, which distinguished him over other researchers. In addition, the applicant's findings were used in the development
of a drug to treat leukemia that is produced by a top pharmaceutical company. The beneficiary is a member of several
professional societies that are integral to the field, such as the American Chemical Society, the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">2.
The General
Guidance for Reference Letters</font></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Many immigration experts
believe that reference letters
are necessary for EB1-Extraordinary Ability application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> I</span>f an application is simply a listing of evidence <o:p>where reference letters are
the main sources of discussion of the applicant's work, then the reference letters must
be of high <o:p>quality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, if the application contains background information on the
applicant's work, its actual and <o:p>potential benefits, the
national or international importance, etc., then the USCIS examiners may see
what criteria can be <o:p>met without many reference letters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The key is to determine each
type of evidence and demonstrate how it satisfies the requirements of the EB1-EA
criteria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This is what
reference letters are meant to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The reference
letters should be used properly, as a piece
of supporting evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">An alien applicant should have four to five reference letters from senior experts in the field attesting to his/her significant contributions to the field and national or international reputation in the field. It is recommended that a variety of reference letters come from people outside the current employer and outside the U.S., and from senior experts in U.S. government and industry.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The basic contents of a reference letter should include:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Writer's qualifications to issue his/her
  opinion, and the position of the writer in the field (or include a copy of the writer's CV);&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  2) How the writer knows the alien's
  work;<br>
  <br>
  3) Alien's background and achievements, as well as commentaries on how the alien's achievements are original contributions of major
  significance, and how the alien's
  work has made significant or outstanding contributions to the field;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  4) References to the alien's
  extraordinary ability, such as evidence of presentations at national or international conferences, publications in national or international
  journals, memberships in selective associations or societies; receipts of prizes or awards;<br>
  <br>
  5) Alien possesses unique knowledge, abilities, or experience that sets him/her apart from the professional
  peers, and references or descriptions as to how
  the alien
  may benefit the U.S. in the future;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  6) The letters should explain in specific terms why the experts believe the beneficiary
  has extraordinary ability. It should include statements which refer to the alien as an "extraordinary researcher (or professor) in the field&quot;, or
  "researcher (or professor) with extraordinary ability in the field.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">It is usually recommended that
the reference letters should come from the following individuals:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Letters from experts in a field, in U.S. or outside U.S.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) At least one letter from a representative of the alien's present employer who is both highly credentialed and knowledgeable of the alien's work.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">3) Letters from experts
who were the alien's academic advisor, or who collaborated with the alien on the research leading to a final product, thesis, or
paper.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">4) Letters from past employers who
are highly credentialed and knowledgeable of the alien's work.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">3. What
Should be Included in a Reference Letter</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Strong reference letters are
key to a successful EB1-Extraordinary Ability petition. Applicants should realize the significant role
that reference letters play in the success of an EB1-Extraordinary Ability petition. Filing an
EB1-Extraordinary Ability petition is a significant step and should not be taken lightly. Due to the
prolonged processing time, reckless filing will substantially delay the time you
receive a Green Card. Moreover, although the law does not preclude the
possibility of repeated filing under the same category, if you file anther EB1-Extraordinary Ability
petition after the rejected one without having significant improvement of your
credentials, your case will very likely be rejected again.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><i><font size="2">1) Qualifications
  of the Recommender:</font></i></b><font size="2"> A reference letter needs to
  include the description of the drafter. An introduction of the employer should
  be made if a job has been offered. If the drafter comments on the foreign
  person's achievements or research, a statement should be included in the
  support letter that establishes the qualifications of these individuals to
  judge the applicant's work.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Helpful testimonials from
  experts should set apart the applicant from other persons in the field. Expert
  testimonials of your accomplishments are crucial to your petition. However,
  keep in mind that expert testimonials should bolster the argument that you
  meet the standard set by law, i.e., that you are one of those few who have
  risen to the top of the field. Evidence that merely establishes your
  competence or which fails to set you apart from other persons in the field
  does not support your case because it carries little weight and may actually
  be used to deny the petition.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><i><font size="2">2) Substantive
  Information:</font></i></b><font size="2"> A good reference letter should
  point out the high level of unique expertise the applicant possesses. If it is
  a reference letter from an employer or professor of the applicant, it should
  specify the work the foreign national is responsible for and the requirements
  of the job. Although a job offer is not required for priority workers, a
  reference letter from an employer can cite to such a position to establish
  that very few individuals can fill the offered position (i.e., only top
  individuals in the field or those with exceptional ability can perform the
  duties required for the position) and the alien is one of these few
  individuals. In addition, reference letters that briefly discuss the
  petitioner's activities and described him or her as a knowledgeable
  individual, but lack specific information regarding how the petitioner's
  contributions had significantly and consistently influenced the field are
  insufficient.<br>
  <br>
  For example, in establishing a foreign national's extraordinary ability for
  EB1-EA purposes, the recommender must pay close attention to the criteria
  specified in the regulations; the recommender may cite to the types of
  evidence listed in the regulations. The mere cite to public policy is not a
  substitute for documentation of extraordinary ability. In addition, the USCIS
  has made it clear that merely submitting types of documentation from the
  categories listed in the regulations is insufficient; the evidence must
  ultimately establish that the beneficiary is a foreign national of
  extraordinary ability. Considering the importance of reference letters, it is
  worth the time and efforts for an applicant to seek perfect recommenders and
  discuss the content of the reference letter with them to boost your chance of
  approval.</font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">4. Detailed
Guidelines on the General Format that Most Reference Letters Should Take</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Quality reference letters are a
critical element of a successful EB1-Extraordinary Ability application. While
there is no required number of letters for an EB1-EA petition, in our
experience, 6-8 letters is a good rule of thumb for most applications. Much more
important than the quantity of the letters is the quality of the letters
themselves. It is better to have 4 high quality letters from established
authorities in the field who do not have a relationship with you, than to have
20 mediocre letters from your colleagues at work. Below are detailed guidelines
on the general format most letters should take.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><font size="2" face="Arial">First Section: </font></i></b><font size="2" face="Arial">This
  first section should discuss how the author knows the petitioner and his or
  her work. If the author does not personally know the petitioner, then be sure
  to mention that in this section – letters from independent authors carry
  more weight with USCIS, and you want to be sure to establish this at the
  beginning of the letter.<br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Second Section:</i></b> In this section, the author should discuss where
  he or she works, work experience, and other credentials. Basically, the author
  must convince the Adjudicating Officer that he or she is qualified to review
  the impact of petitioner’s work on the field. The author will want to list
  any positions or titles, as well as his or her educational background.<br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Third Section: </i></b>This section should be the longest and it is the
  most important. Here, the author will discuss what he or she knows of
  petitioner’s work and explain the national or international significance of
  petitioner’s work, and the petitioner's scientific contribution to the
  field.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) It is especially
    important that the author thoroughly discuss how petitioner has already
    significantly impacted your field.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>- Key
    Words and Phrases Example: </i>“Dr. Kim’s research has already
    significantly impacted our field through his discovery of…”<br>
    <br>
    2) Also discuss why petitioner’s research/work is groundbreaking and of
    such importance to the field.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>- Key Words and Phrases Example: </i>“Dr. Kasina’s
    seminal study into the causes of this disease was groundbreaking and pointed
    research into this disease into an entirely new direction by…”<br>
    <br>
    3) The author can also discuss in detail how the petitioner’s work has
    significantly advanced important goals in your field.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>- Key Words and Phrases Example: </i>“For a long
    time our field has searched in vain for the pathogenesis of this disease.
    Dr. Jarrett’s study has finally done it….”<br>
    <br>
    4) The author may also point out why the petitioner is one of the few person
    at the top of the field, and much better than a similarly qualified U.S.
    worker.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>- Key Words and Phrases Example:</i> “While there
    are literally thousands of post-doc researchers in this country, finding one
    with the skills and achievements of Dr. Serna would be exceedingly
    difficult.”<br>
    <br>
    5) Additionally, the author should discuss the “national or international
    impact and contribution” of the Applicant’s work.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>- Key Words and Phrases Example: </i>“The treatment
    pioneered by Dr. Jia will have a direct national and international impact on
    those patients afflicted with cancer…”</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Fourth Section:</font></i></b><font size="2" face="Arial">
  In the conclusion section, the author should write why he or she believes the
  petitioner’s continued presence in this country will benefit the field and
  United States. i.e. “It would be in the best interest of the United States
  if Dr. Genius were allowed to stay in the country because…”<br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Overall Length: </i></b>There is no rule of thumb on the length of the
  letter. If you follow the above guidelines your letter will probably end up 1
  ½ to three pages in length.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#006666" size="2" face="Arial">5. Some Key
Factors to Consider When Procuring Your Reference Letters</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Below is a detailed analysis
explaining some key factors to consider when procuring your reference letters:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) It is worth reiterating
  that letters from people you do not have a personal or professional
  relationship with will carry more weight with the USCIS than those from people
  who know you. That is not to say that letters from people that know, such as
  your colleagues or your boss, are not important, these should definitely be
  included as well. But you should try to include at least 2-3 letters from
  independent experts (those who do not have a personal or professional
  relationship with you).</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Usually, if the author of
  the letter is in a high position in the organization, the letter will carry
  more weight. For example, a letter from the “Director of Research at
  Laboratory X” will carry more weight than a letter from a “Research
  Associate at Laboratory X”.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">3) Letters from nationally
  recognized agencies such as <i>The National Science Foundation, American
  Cancer Society, U.S. Department of Energy</i>, etc. are extremely persuasive.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">4) Letters from private
  research laboratories (that you are not employed at) or research institutions
  such as <i>Amgen</i>, or <i>U.C. Berkeley</i> are also very persuasive. Again,
  try to get letters from those higher up such as directors or lead researchers.<br>
  <br>
  5) Also, make sure that the general language and tone for each of the letters
  differs from one another. USCIS may get suspicious if all of the letters are
  in the same voice or from the same template. Be sure to change some of the
  structure and language if your authors are all going off the same template.<br>
  <br>
  6) And of course, don’t forget to thank the authors of your letters!</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The details for a strong reference
letter should include:</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) The reference letters should come from independent experts
in government agencies, premier universities, as well as those from nationally or internationally
renowned persons, verifying that the applicant was one of the leading
experts in the field.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) The reference letters should state that the applicant's extensive credentials and abilities could not be replicated by training others in the field, and these experts should place the applicant at the top of the field. The testimonies from experts/scholars should describe how the applicant has contributed to the academic field.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">3) The reference letters should provide arguments that the applicant's work benefits the health of U.S. citizens, the U.S. environment, economy, or national security.
As an example of benefiting the health of U.S. citizens, the applicant's work may result in advancements of significant benefit to research on viral infections, diabetes, tuberculosis, pneumonia, or antibiotic resistance, and so
on.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">4) The reference letters should mention that the applicant is a member of several professional societies that are integral to the field.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">5) The reference letters may mention that the applicant intends to
continue to work in the area of his or her extraordinary ability which will substantially benefit the interests of the United States in some
degree.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">6) The important issue to keep in mind when applying for the extraordinary ability category is
the uniqueness. The reference letters should show that the applicant is not
a normal, average individual in the field,&nbsp; and the applicant stands out among the crowd in knowledge, skills, and talent.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">7) What form should the reference
letters take?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The most important rule is that there is no proper
format for reference letters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In fact, if
a person gets more than
one reference letter, they should be of varying formats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</font></p>
